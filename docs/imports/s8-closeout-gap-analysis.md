## Remaining blockers (must be 0 P1 for READY)

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| G1/G2 Full browser workflow | DEF-S8-002 | OPEN | create→upload→execute via UI |

## Execution order remaining

1. Full Import Center UI workflow automation (DEF-S8-002)  
2. Privileged + UI perf + a11y completion (003/004/005)  
3. Template.manage route or documented N/A acceptance (007)  
4. Retriable DLQ on worker `:26` (012)  
5. Aurora 25k/100k + concurrency ceiling (015/016)  
6. Alarm suite + backup restore (017/018)  
7. Re-evaluate READY vs NOT_READY  

**Stop condition met this pass:** `NOT_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (P1 ≠ 0).
