# Import Platform — Open Limitation Register

**Document:** `docs/imports/import-platform-open-limitations.md`  
**Created:** 2026-07-29 (Sprint S8 baseline)  
**Updated:** 2026-07-30 (Sprint S8 closeout — deploy `:40`/`:25`, Option B named)  
**Status:** OPEN register — no limitation may be removed without closure evidence or formal deferral  
**Environment context:** development AWS `511343547817` / `us-east-1`  
**Deployed baseline:** tag `import-s8-20260729182259`, API TD `:40`, worker TD `:25`, migration `0027`

**S8 decision note:** (1) **Malware scanner** — ADR **Outcome B** production block for `reference-malware@1` (LIM-IMP-001 MITIGATED; Outcome A still required). (2) **Step Functions** — ADR Option B **`RETAIN_SQS_ECS_WORKER_PATH`** — API → SQS → ECS worker; SFN inactive; decision is **not** PENDING. See `docs/decisions/import-malware-provider-production-decision.md` and `docs/decisions/import-step-functions-production-decision.md`.

**S8 closeout evidence gaps (still open):** full browser E2E create→execute; Aurora load matrix (100k/250k **not** claimed); worker recovery drill; rollback rehearsal (`NOT_EXECUTED`); backup restore; live permission HTTP matrix; canary log hunt; DLQ poison exercise may still be running; Playwright suite added but green run **NOT_VERIFIED**.

## LIM-IMP-001 — Reference malware provider

| Field               | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ID                  | LIM-IMP-001                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Description         | Active scanner is `reference-malware@1` (`ReferenceMalwareScanner`): marks CLEAN unless EICAR hash or synthetic key/file signals. Not a production multi-engine / GuardDuty Malware Protection provider. |
| Originating sprint  | S6                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Current impact      | Development/testing use reference provider. Production-like `APP_ENV` values refuse reference provider (`IMPORT_SCANNER_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`).                                                          |
| Security impact     | Detection coverage remains synthetic in allowed envs; production-like untrusted imports are blocked rather than falsely protected.                                                                       |
| Operational impact  | Scanner swap still requires provider implementation + config/wiring; no live GuardDuty/AV pipeline.                                                                                                      |
| User impact         | Quarantine/scan UX in dev depends on reference signals; production-like upload/scan paths fail closed with clear error.                                                                                  |
| Production impact   | **Blocked for untrusted file imports** until Outcome A provider authorized (Outcome B).                                                                                                                  |
| Existing mitigation | `ImportMalwareScanner` interface; fail-closed execute/approve gates; quarantine path; **`assertScannerAllowedForEnvironment`** (no admin bypass).                                                        |
| Required action     | Authorize and implement production scanner provider (**Outcome A**); retain interface; evidence of provider cutover + fail-closed regression. Outcome B remains until then.                              |
| Owner               | Platform security / Import Platform engineering (interim)                                                                                                                                                |
| Status              | **MITIGATED**                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Acceptance decision | **Outcome B** — production imports blocked with reference scanner; S8 ADR accepted. Still open for real provider (Outcome A).                                                                            |
| Closure evidence    | `docs/decisions/import-malware-provider-production-decision.md`; `packages/imports/src/security/production-guards.ts`; unit coverage in `s8-hardening.unit.test.ts`                                      |
| Deferred sprint     | Outcome A provider integration requires separate authorization (not closed by Outcome B)                                                                                                                 |

## LIM-IMP-002 — Inactive Step Functions

| Field               | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| ID                  | LIM-IMP-002                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Description         | Import execution Step Functions remain definition-complete / not active. Package ASL includes `SecurityVerdictGate`; CDK construct historically `activate: false`; live account has **no** import state machine (`list-state-machines` empty). Operational path is API → SQS → ECS worker only. |
| Originating sprint  | S5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Current impact      | Orchestration durability/visibility is worker+DB based, not SFN executions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Security impact     | Medium residual if ops assume SFN gate is live — mitigated by ADR Option B `RETAIN_SQS_ECS_WORKER_PATH` and API/worker gates.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Operational impact  | No SFN console/ops tooling for import runs; runbooks/monitoring target SQS/worker/DLQ only.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| User impact         | None direct if worker path healthy. UI must not claim SFN is active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Production impact   | SFN activation not part of production path (**Option B — `RETAIN_SQS_ECS_WORKER_PATH`**).                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Existing mitigation | Worker consumer for `IMPORT_EXECUTE` / malware / upload detect; API state machine + locks; security gates in API/worker; deployed worker TD `:25`.                                                                                                                                              |
| Required action     | Only if product/ops later authorize `ACTIVATE_STEP_FUNCTIONS`: deploy/align ASL, EventBridge Pipe (or equivalent), tests, cost review — per ADR future criteria.                                                                                                                                |

| Acceptance decision | **ADR Option B — `RETAIN_SQS_ECS_WORKER_PATH`** — keep API → SQS → ECS; do not activate merely because a definition exists; no activation in S8 closeout.                                                                                                                                       |

## LIM-IMP-003 — Aurora-scale validation

| Field               | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Current impact      | Capacity and contention characteristics under realistic Aurora load are unknown (serverless writer + worker 256/512 deployed but unmeasured under import load).                                                                                                                     |
| Security impact     | Low direct; potential RLS/lock contention under load is unproven.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Operational impact  | Cannot set evidence-based scaling alarms/thresholds beyond SQS backlog heuristics.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| User impact         | Risk of slow jobs / timeouts under concurrent tenants (unmeasured).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Production impact   | Scale claims not authorized; freeze row/concurrency limits remain **NOT_VERIFIED** placeholders.                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## LIM-IMP-004 — Full rollback compensation

| Field               | Value                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Description         | Rollback APIs/UI submit **classification requests** only (`SAFE` / `CONDITIONAL` / `UNSAFE` / `EXPIRED`). Full compensating transactions / destination undo are not executed. |
| Originating sprint  | S5                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Current impact      | `ROLLBACK_PENDING` / `ROLLBACK_REFUSED` reflect classification, not completed compensation.                                                                                   |
| Security impact     | Low–medium — operators may assume data was undone when only classified.                                                                                                       |
| Operational impact  | Manual remediation required for unsafe commits.                                                                                                                               |
| User impact         | UI wording (S7) warns classification-only; no full undo.                                                                                                                      |
| Production impact   | Cannot promise automated rollback safety for production imports.                                                                                                              |
| Existing mitigation | Explicit UI copy; rollback safety enums; journal preparation fields.                                                                                                          |
| Required action     | Design and authorize compensation adapters per product; or formal deferral with operator runbook.                                                                             |

| Current impact      | Progress UI updates on poll cadence only.                                                                                                   |
| Security impact     | Low.                                                                                                                                        |
| Operational impact  | Extra API read load under many concurrent monitors.                                                                                         |
| User impact         | Slight lag vs true real-time; acceptable for MVP.                                                                                           |
| Production impact   | Optional enhancement; not a production blocker by itself.                                                                                   |
| Existing mitigation | Poll interval + clear on terminal; permission-gated status reads.                                                                           |

| Description         | Mapping UI uses generic product/module/record keys and neutral fixtures. No product-owned field catalogs (RMS/Academy/etc.) wired into Import Center. |
| Originating sprint  | S7 (adapters deferred since S5)                                                                                                                       |
| Current impact      | Operators map against generic/server keys only.                                                                                                       |
| Security impact     | Low — avoids incorrect product writes; no adapters committing product data.                                                                           |
| Operational impact  | Product go-live imports blocked until adapters/catalogs authorized.                                                                                   |

| Description         | Sensitive-field classification relies on name-hint heuristics + config defaults, not complete product sensitivity metadata catalogs. |
| Originating sprint  | S6                                                                                                                                   |
| Current impact      | Masking is conservative but may miss product-specific sensitive fields without hints.                                                |
| Security impact     | Medium — over-mask preferred; CREDENTIAL never unmasked; residual under-classification risk for unlabeled fields.                    |
| Operational impact  | Security report / download masking quality depends on heuristics.                                                                    |
| User impact         | Some fields may show as masked/unmasked incorrectly relative to product policy.                                                      |
| Production impact   | Prefer product metadata before broad sensitive-data enablement.                                                                      |
| Existing mitigation | Conservative masking; `import.sensitive` for privileged download; audit events.                                                      |
| Required action     | Product sensitivity metadata via adapters/config; expand tests.                                                                      |

| Description         | Import Center mapping/workspace is desktop/tablet-first; narrow phone layouts are limited. |
| Originating sprint  | S7                                                                                         |

| User impact         | Mobile operators may struggle with mapping grids.                                          |
| Production impact   | Acceptable if operator persona is desktop; gap for phone-first tenants.                    |
| Existing mitigation | Desktop/tablet primary design; responsive basics only.                                     |

| Description         | Quarantined files can be viewed/rescanned in workflow; there is no authorized **release-from-quarantine** control that restores a previously INFECTED/QUARANTINED object to a clean executable path without rescan/policy gates. Override release is also unavailable (see LIM-IMP-010). |
| Originating sprint  | S6 (API quarantine); S7 (UI quarantine view without release)                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Current impact      | Quarantine is sticky aside from rescan transitions defined by server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Security impact     | Positive fail-closed posture; release absence prevents unsafe unblock.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Operational impact  | Operators must rescan or abandon; no one-click release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| Security impact     | Positive — reduces unsafe bypass; false positives require rescan/provider fix.                                                                        |

Suite file `apps/configuration-e2e/tests/import-center-s8.spec.ts` was **added** (dashboard axe + landmarks) but recorded run failed to launch Chromium — green evidence **NOT_VERIFIED**.

| Description         | Unit test proves `clearImportTenantCache` clears in-memory buckets; **no** browser evidence that tenant switch during an active Import Center workflow clears cache and prevents cross-tenant UI leakage. |

| Description         | Protected download helper fetches short-lived URL, blobs to object URL, clicks download, revokes object URL, and clears active URL in `finally`. Unit tests cover dispose/expiry helpers only — **no** browser evidence for privileged/masked download flows, expiration, or non-persistence in history/storage. |

| Security impact     | Medium — URL exfiltration window if clients retain presigns.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Operational impact  | Harder to audit client-side URL lifecycle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| User impact         | None visible if working; residual privacy risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Production impact   | Hardening evidence required for browser data-safety.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Existing mitigation | Short TTL presigns; queue contract forbids URLs; `disposeDownloadUrl` / revokeObjectURL in download helper.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Required action     | Browser data-safety evidence covering upload + artifact presign disposal; expand tests as needed.                                                                                                                                                              |

| Acceptance decision | Architectural mitigation accepted; browser disposal evidence still open.                                                                                                                                                                                       |

**Rule:** No row may be deleted. Transition to CLOSED only with `Closure evidence` filled, or to DEFERRED with `Deferred sprint` + acceptance decision recorded. MITIGATED means residual risk is controlled (e.g. Outcome B) but may still require a follow-on action (e.g. Outcome A provider).
