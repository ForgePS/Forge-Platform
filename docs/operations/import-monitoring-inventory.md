# Import Platform — Monitoring Inventory

**Document:** `docs/operations/import-monitoring-inventory.md`  
**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Environment:** development (`511343547817` / `us-east-1`)  
**Deployed:** tag `import-s8-20260729182259`, API `:40`, worker `:25`  
**Execution path:** API → SQS → ECS (`RETAIN_SQS_ECS_WORKER_PATH`) — monitoring does **not** depend on Step Functions

## Dashboards (CLI published)

Script: `scripts/put-import-dashboards.mjs`

| Dashboard |
| --- |
| `ForgePlatform-Development-Import-Operations` |
| `ForgePlatform-Development-Import-Security` |
| `ForgePlatform-Development-Import-Queue-Worker` |
| `ForgePlatform-Development-Import-Performance` |
| `ForgePlatform-Development-Import-Tenant-Access` |

## Alarms

| Alarm | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forge-development-alarm-imports-backlog` | Queue visible ≥ 100 | Baseline **OK** |
| `forge-development-alarm-importsdlq` | DLQ visible ≥ 1 | Baseline **OK** |
| `forge-development-alarm-imports-queue-age` | Queue age | Created (may be `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`) |
| `forge-development-alarm-worker-running-tasks` | Worker capacity | Created (may be `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`) |
| `forge-development-alarm-import-scanner-blocked` | Scanner blocked metric | Created (may be `INSUFFICIENT_DATA`) |

CDK construct `forge-monitoring.ts` includes queue-age / worker / scanner-blocked; CLI alarms created — full CDK synth/deploy parity **NOT_VERIFIED** as continuous.

## Metrics sources

| Source | Use |
| --- | --- |
| AWS/SQS | Imports queue + DLQ depths / age |
| AWS/ECS | API + worker CPU/memory / running count |
| AWS/RDS | Aurora cluster (dashboard widgets) |
| `ForgePlatform/ImportSecurity` | Scanner-blocked EMF (when emitted) |

## Runbooks

| Condition | Runbook |
| --- | --- |
| Backlog / queue age | `docs/operations/import-runbook.md` |
| DLQ | `docs/operations/import-dlq-runbook.md` |
| Worker down | `docs/operations/import-worker-recovery.md` |
| Stuck job | `docs/operations/import-stuck-job-runbook.md` |
| Outcome B / scanner | ADR + `docs/operations/import-runbook.md` |

## Explicit non-dependencies

- No Step Functions execution metrics required for S8 ops (Option B).  
- Safe alarm trigger tests for all new alarms: **NOT_VERIFIED**.
