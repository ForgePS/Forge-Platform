# Import Platform — Operations Runbook Index (S8)

**Document:** `docs/operations/import-runbook.md`  
**Role:** Master ops index for Universal Import Platform  
**Execution path:** API → SQS → ECS worker (Step Functions Option B — inactive)

## Production restrictions (read first)

| Restriction | Decision | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reference-malware@1` | ADR Outcome B | Untrusted file imports **blocked** in production-like `APP_ENV` (`staging`, `production`, `govcloud-*`) |
| Step Functions | ADR Option B | No live state machine; do not page on SFN |
| Product adapters | Out of scope | Reference adapter / generic keys only |
| Migrations | Through `0027` | No S8 schema change expected for hardening-only |

Guards: `packages/imports/src/security/production-guards.ts`  
ADRs: `docs/decisions/import-malware-provider-production-decision.md`, `docs/decisions/import-step-functions-production-decision.md`

## Quick triage

| Symptom | Start here |
| --- | --- |
| DLQ depth ≥ 1 / `importsdlq` ALARM | [DLQ runbook](./import-dlq-runbook.md) — tooling `scripts/import-dlq-ops.mjs` |
| Worker crash / zero tasks / redelivery storms | [Worker recovery](./import-worker-recovery.md) |
| Job stale in SCANNING / QUEUED / PROCESSING / … | [Stuck job](./import-stuck-job-runbook.md) — thresholds in `STUCK_JOB_THRESHOLDS_MS` |
| Cancel mid-flight | [Cancellation](./import-cancellation-runbook.md) |
| Data loss / corruption / DR drill | [Backup / restore](./import-backup-restore.md) |
| Upload/scan refused in staging/production | [Scanner restriction](#scanner-restriction-outcome-b) |

## Runbook catalog

| Topic | Document |
| --- | --- |
| DLQ inspect / dry-run / replay | `docs/operations/import-dlq-runbook.md` |
| Worker failure & lock recovery | `docs/operations/import-worker-recovery.md` |
| Stuck job detection | `docs/operations/import-stuck-job-runbook.md` |
| Cancellation (QUEUED / PROCESSING) | `docs/operations/import-cancellation-runbook.md` |
| Backup / PITR / S3 versioning | `docs/operations/import-backup-restore.md` |
| Legacy retry/DLQ notes | `docs/operations/import-retry-dlq-runbook.md` (prefer S8 DLQ runbook) |
| Platform overview ops | `docs/operations/import-platform.md` |

## Stuck thresholds (canonical)

| Status | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| SCANNING | 15 minutes |
| VALIDATING | 30 minutes |
| READY_FOR_PREVIEW | 30 minutes |
| QUEUED | 30 minutes |
| PROCESSING | 2 hours |
| ROLLBACK_PENDING | 24 hours |

Source: `STUCK_JOB_THRESHOLDS_MS` in `@forge/imports`.

## Batch defaults

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Default batch size | 50 |
| Minimum | 1 |
| Maximum | 500 |
| Recommended range | 50–250 |

Source: `S8_BATCH_RECOMMENDATION` / `DEFAULT_EXECUTION_BATCH_SIZE`.

## Scanner restriction (Outcome B)

In production-like environments, API upload initialize/complete and worker malware processing **refuse** `reference-malware`. Error code: `IMPORT_SCANNER_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`. **No administrator bypass.**

Allowed for scanner use: `local`, `development`, `testing` only.

Ops response:

1. Confirm `APP_ENV` and configured provider key.
2. Do not attempt config bypass.
3. Inform requestor that production imports require an authorized production-grade provider (Outcome A).
4. Cite ADR + limitation LIM-IMP-001 (MITIGATED / Outcome B).

## Alarms (development naming)

| Alarm | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `forge-*-alarm-importsdlq` | Imports DLQ visible ≥ 1 |
| `forge-*-alarm-imports-backlog` | Imports queue visible ≥ 100 (sustained) |
| `forge-*-alarm-imports-queue-age` | Age / lag signal (when present) |
| `forge-*-alarm-worker-running-tasks` | Worker capacity |

1. Platform on-call  
2. Import Platform engineering  
3. Security (malware, quarantine, isolation, Outcome B disputes)  
4. DB on-call (Aurora lock / PITR)
