# Import Center — User Guide

**Status:** Draft (architecture stop — UI not shipped yet)  
**Date:** 2026-07-28  
**Audience:** Tenant administrators, Configuration Managers, Platform Support

## What it is

The **Import Center** is Forge’s shared place to upload and import records for any product (Academy, RMS, Industrial, Creator operations). One engine serves every product.

Configuration Studio defines import **profiles**. The Import Center **runs** imports.

## High-level steps

1. Select **Product** → **Module** → **Record type**  
2. Download a **template** (optional)  
3. **Upload** a CSV, XLSX, JSON, or ZIP migration bundle  
4. Confirm **column mapping** (from profile or manual)  
5. **Resolve errors** shown per row (invalid rows are never silently dropped)  
6. Review **duplicates** (Create / Update / Skip / Reject / Merge Review)  
7. **Preview** counts and sample rows  
8. **Approve** and **Execute**  
9. **Monitor** progress  
10. Download **results** / rejected-row export  
11. **Rollback** only when the system marks the job as safely reversible  

## Security notes

- Files upload directly to encrypted storage via a short-lived link.  
- Malware scanning runs before the file is read.  
- You can only import into your own tenant.
