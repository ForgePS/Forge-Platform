# Import Execution Architecture (S5)

## Relationship

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| API | Control plane (`execute`, `cancel`, `status`, `results`, batches, errors, rollback-request) |
| SQS (`forge-{env}-sqs-imports`) | Execution trigger (`IMPORT_EXECUTE` v1) |
| Step Functions | Orchestration definition (ASL + CDK) — **DEFINITION_COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_PENDING** |
| ECS worker | Import processing (polls SQS; upload detect + execute) |
| Adapters | Product record operations via registry (reference adapter only in S5) |
| PostgreSQL | Durable job/row/batch/audit/rollback journal |
| S3 | Source files and large artifacts |

## State transitions (execution)

`APPROVED → QUEUED → PROCESSING → COMPLETED | COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS | FAILED`

Cancellation: `QUEUED → CANCELLED`; `PROCESSING` sets `cancellationRequested` and stops at safe checkpoint.

Rollback prep: `COMPLETED|COMPLETED_WITH_ERRORS → ROLLBACK_PENDING` or `ROLLBACK_REFUSED`.

## Idempotency

- Execution idempotency key on job
- Batch idempotency key
- Journal idempotency per tenant/job/row/adapter
- Reference adapter in-memory upsert key

Guarantees: **at-least-once** queue delivery; **effectively-once** commits via journal + row status.
