# Import Platform — UI Architecture (S8)

**Document:** `docs/architecture/import-ui.md`  
**Package:** `@forge/import-center`  
**Surfaces:** Creator Console + Tenant Admin `/imports/`

## Design

Shared Import Center consumes Import Platform APIs (OpenAPI `0.6.0-s6`). No product-specific UI forks. No product field catalogs (generic keys only).

## Routing (static export)

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/imports/` | Dashboard |
| `/imports/?view=new` | New import + upload |
| `/imports/?jobId=&view=` | State-driven workspace |

Views include: security, mapping, validation, preview, duplicates, approval, execute, execution, results, quarantine, profiles, templates.

`resolveImportWorkflowView` maps server job status → allowed view. Query-param workspace matches `output: "export"` apps.

## Permissions (UI)

UI hides/disables controls via `IMPORT_PERMISSION_MATRIX`. **UI is not the enforcement boundary** — API still authorizes.

| Permission | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| `import.view` | Dashboard, job views, masked downloads |
| `import.upload` | New import / upload / abort |
| `import.map` | Mapping save |
| `import.validate` | Validation, rescan |
| `import.preview` | Preview request |
| `import.approve` | Approve / reject |
| `import.execute` | Execute / cancel |
| `import.rollback` | Rollback classification request |
| `import.profile.manage` | Profile admin |
| `import.template.manage` | Template admin |
| `import.error.reprocess` | Error retry |
| `import.sensitive` | Privileged download request |

## Security UX

- States Outcome B restriction: production-like imports blocked without production scanner.
- No malware override control.
- Quarantine view without release button.
- Rollback copy: classification request only.
- Tenant switch clears in-memory import cache (`clearImportTenantCache`).
- Protected downloads dispose object URLs; do not log/persist presigns.

## Execution monitor

Polls job status every **~3 seconds**; stops on terminal states. No WebSocket/SSE (LIM-IMP-005).

## Accessibility & responsive (S8 honesty)

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Semantic headings/labels | Present in panels (code-level) |
| Playwright / axe suite | **Not greenfield-complete** — requirements in `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-accessibility.md` |
| Narrow phone mapping | Limited (LIM-IMP-008); desktop/tablet first |
| Browser tenant-switch / download evidence | Still needed (LIM-IMP-012/013/014) |
