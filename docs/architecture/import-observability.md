# Import Platform — Observability (S8)

**Document:** `docs/architecture/import-observability.md`

## Signals

| Layer | Signal | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SQS | Visible messages, age, DLQ depth | Primary ops signals |
| ECS | Running task count, events, deploy revisions | API + worker services |
| CloudWatch Logs | correlationId / jobId / tenantId | Never log raw row PII or presigns |
| Aurora | Lock contention, slow queries (standard DB ops) | No import-specific EMF pack required for S8 |
| App | Job status / progress percent / scan events | UI polls ~3s |

## Alarms (CDK `ForgeMonitoring`)

| Alarm pattern | Metric | Threshold |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `*-alarm-importsdlq` | DLQ `ApproximateNumberOfMessagesVisible` | ≥ 1 |
| `*-alarm-imports-backlog` | Queue visible messages | ≥ 100 (multi-period) |
| Worker running tasks | ECS desired/running | capacity loss |

Development inspection (S8 baseline): `forge-development-alarm-importsdlq` and `imports-backlog` were **OK**; DLQ depth **0**.

No dedicated “malware scan latency” CloudWatch alarm ships in CDK for S8 — monitor SCANNING stuck jobs via thresholds + logs.

## Dashboards

Platform overview dashboards include imports queue + DLQ widgets where configured (`ForgePlatform-*-Overview`).

## Correlation

Every mutating import path should carry `correlationId` (API + queue messages). DLQ tooling emits an ops `correlationId` per session (`scripts/import-dlq-ops.mjs`).

## Stuck job monitoring

Use `isStuckImportJob` thresholds:

| Status | Threshold |
| --- | --- |
| SCANNING | 15m |
| VALIDATING / READY_FOR_PREVIEW / QUEUED | 30m |
| PROCESSING | 2h |
| ROLLBACK_PENDING | 24h |

Emit operational tickets with jobId + tenantId + correlationId only (no payload dumps).

## What not to log

- Presigned URLs  
- Raw imported row values / credentials  
- Full SQS message bodies into tickets (DLQ script already redacts Body)  
- Malware binary content  

## Runbooks

Master index: `docs/operations/import-runbook.md`

## Gaps (honest)

- Aurora multi-tenant scale metrics baselines: **PENDING_CONTROLLED_RUN** (LIM-IMP-003).
- Custom EMF import stage timers: not a shipped S8 requirement; add only with authorization.
