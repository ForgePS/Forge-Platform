# DM-S1 Source → Target Matrix v2

**Source:** `forge-industrial-safety`  
**Companion:** `DM-S1-TARGET-SCHEMA-CONTRACT.md`  
**Rule:** Extraction preserves raw source. Transform/import is later.

## Disposition legend

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| DIRECT | Near 1:1 |
| TRANSFORM | Field/type reshape |
| SPLIT | One source → many targets |
| MERGE | Many sources → one target |
| PLATFORM_GLOBAL | Platform-owned; not customer tenant copy |
| ARCHIVE_ONLY | Keep in package / offline archive; not live SoT |
| EXCLUDE_WITH_APPROVAL | Skip unless explicitly approved |
| TARGET_MISSING | TARGET_SCHEMA_GAP — AWS import blocked for this domain |
| UNKNOWN | Insufficient certainty (drive toward zero) |

## UNKNOWN → reduced

Remaining UNKNOWN should be empty for named operational collections above. Residual UNKNOWN only where live collection appears in extract but is not listed here — extractor reports must flag those for matrix amendment.

## GLOBAL record policy (summary)

| Collection | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| ehsAuditTemplates | PLATFORM_GLOBAL |
| ehsAuditTemplateVersions | PLATFORM_GLOBAL (REFERENCE_GLOBAL for tenant copies created later) |

GLOBAL records **must not** be copied into an arbitrary customer tenant.

## Workers Comp / medical

| Aspect | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| Source collections | `workersComp*` family (cases + satellites) |
| Target mapping | AMBIGUOUS for cases; MISSING_TARGET for medical satellites |
| Policy | REQUIRES_POLICY_DECISION — no raw medical values in committed docs |
| Retention | Follow Forge higher-sensitivity handling; do not land in unrestricted logs |

## QR / audit retention dispositions

| Stream | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| qr_link_scan_events | UNKNOWN → prefer ARCHIVE_ONLY or DO_NOT_MIGRATE until scan schema exists; do not discard package yet |
| qr_link_audit_events | MIGRATE_RETENTION_WINDOW or ARCHIVE_ONLY |
| documentAccessEvents | ARCHIVE_ONLY / DO_NOT_MIGRATE |
| auth_audit_logs | MIGRATE_RETENTION_WINDOW |
| activityLogs | ARCHIVE_ONLY |
| platform audit / billing notifications | EXCLUDE_WITH_APPROVAL or ARCHIVE_ONLY |
