Detection method for Firestore collections: compare `_migration.documentId` presence and `_migration.documentUpdateTime` equality between baseline DM-S1 package and CAI-S2 capture. Property-order-only serialization differences are ignored.

### Producers-owned subset

### Top changed collections

| Collection | CREATED | UPDATED | DELETED | Producers Δ | Matrix disposition |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| auth_audit_logs | 10 | 0 | 0 | 9 | ARCHIVE → history |
| activityLogs | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | ARCHIVE → history |
| qr_link_scan_events | 5 | 0 | 0 | 5 | APPEND (unsafe strategy) |
| qr_link_audit_events | 4 | 0 | 0 | 4 | ARCHIVE → history |
| organization_users | 0 | 2 | 0 | 1 | users+memberships (non-import file) |

| platformUsers | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | users (non-import file) |

## Unsafe collections

| Collection | Strategy | Drift handling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| content_overrides | EXCLUDE | no APPLY |
| documentAccessEvents | EXCLUDE / history | no destructive rewrite |
| personnelRosterImportSettings | EXCLUDE_APPROVED | no APPLY |
| platformBillingNotifications | PLATFORM exclude | no APPLY |
| qr_link_scan_events | APPEND-only | import new scan events; do not rewrite history |

## Storage drift

| Metric | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Baseline objects | 9303 |
| Current objects | 9305 |
| NEW | 2 |
| UPDATED | 0 |
| DELETED | 0 |

Both new objects are under `module-attachments/.../loto/procedures` (Producers). Target HEAD under promoted `tenants/{liveTenantId}/…` keys: **REUSED** (already present in documents bucket).

## Deletion semantics

No source deletions observed (`DELETED=0`). Matrix for future deletions remains:

| Domain family | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Personnel | SOFT / inactive — never hard delete |
| Safety / incidents / inspections / LOTO / training / WC | IGNORE_SOURCE_DELETE or ARCHIVE — retain history |
| Audit / history streams | APPEND / IGNORE_SOURCE_DELETE |

## Ambiguous ownership

`DELTA_AMBIGUOUS = 0` — every changed document carried an explicit tenant classification/key; non-Producers changes counted as expected skip / non-import.
