## Next authorized sprint (not started)

WRITE FREEZE → FINAL MICRO-DELTA → SYNCHRONIZATION PROOF → CUTOVER READINESS → CUSTOMER TRAFFIC CUTOVER

## Post-watermark drift

`POST_DELTA_SOURCE_DRIFT_COUNT = 0` at measurement time `2026-08-14T13:02:14Z` (live scan vs watermark `2026-08-14T12:42:07.147Z`). Firebase remains live; future writes are expected before freeze.

## Verdict

**READY FOR FINAL WRITE FREEZE + MICRO-DELTA**
