# DM-S0 Source → Target Matrix (Preliminary)

**Source:** Firebase `forge-industrial-safety`  
**Target platform:** Forge AWS Aurora (production schema tip includes through `0038_mk_s21_security_hardening`)  
**Status:** Analysis only — no transforms implemented  

## Important schema note

On the current monorepo tip, Drizzle SQL migrations through `0038` cover platform SaaS foundations (tenants, users, auth, onboarding, billing, notifications, documents branding, jobs, analytics, security hardening). **Industrial domain tables used in prior ind-11 development loads are not present as first-class drizzle migrations in this tip.**  

Therefore many industrial mappings are classified **UNKNOWN / TARGET ONLY (program evidence)** until DM-S1 confirms the production industrial schema package to apply.

## Classification legend

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| DIRECT | Near 1:1 field/entity mapping |
| TRANSFORM | Needs reshaping / type coercion |
| SPLIT | One source → many targets |
| MERGE | Many sources → one target |
| NO TARGET | Intentionally not migrated |
| TARGET ONLY | Exists in AWS without Firebase source |
| UNKNOWN | Insufficient schema certainty |

## Matrix (high level)

| SOURCE FIREBASE | TARGET AWS (intended) | Class | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `organizations` / `platformBusinesses` | `tenants` (+ org records) | TRANSFORM | businessId → tenant_key/id mapping table |
| `organization_users` / `platformUsers` | `users` + `persons` + memberships | SPLIT | Auth UID linkage separate |
| Firebase Auth users | Cognito + `authentication_identities` | TRANSFORM | Prior ind-11 used email join; hash export not in DM-S0 |
| `sites` | facilities / industrial sites | TRANSFORM | Scoped by organizationId |
| `departments` | areas / org units | TRANSFORM | |
| `personnelRecords` | industrial personnel / persons | TRANSFORM | |
| `assetRecords` | industrial equipment | TRANSFORM | |
| `lotoProcedures` / `lotoLibraries` / `lotoRecords` | LOTO procedures/revisions/records | TRANSFORM / SPLIT | |

| `training_courses` / `training_enrollments` | training | TRANSFORM | |
| `*SafetyRecords` module family | module-specific industrial tables | TRANSFORM / UNKNOWN | Confirm target DDL |

| `dotComplianceRecords` / `companyVehicleDrivers*` | DOT / drivers | TRANSFORM | Storage-heavy |
| `qr_links` / versions / audit / scan_* | QR / scan domain | TRANSFORM / PARTIAL NO TARGET | Audit volume large |

| Storage objects | documents bucket keys | TRANSFORM | Path→tenant map |
| `activityLogs` / `*_audit_*` | `audit_events` or archive | MERGE / NO TARGET | Decide retention |
| `platformInvoices` / billing outbox/templates | billing domain | TRANSFORM / NO TARGET | SaaS billing vs customer |
| `super_admins` / `platformSettings` | platform config | TRANSFORM / TARGET ONLY mix | Not customer tenants |
| `content_overrides` | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | Unscoped |
| `equipmentMigrationBatches/rows` | import jobs / discard | NO TARGET / TRANSFORM | Migration tooling residue |
| — | Cognito pool, entitlements, RLS policies | TARGET ONLY | |
| — | Platform catalog permissions/templates | TARGET ONLY | |

## Unknown mappings requiring DM-S1 decisions

1. Exact production industrial DDL to apply before load  
2. Whether QR/scan/audit high-volume streams migrate or archive offline  
3. Handling of `GLOBAL` EHS templates  
4. Whether `business-forge-default` migrates to a platform tenant or is skipped  
5. Workers Comp medical attachments retention/redaction policy  

## Target-only entities (examples)

- Cognito user pool / app clients  
- Aurora RLS session GUCs / bypass patterns  
- Platform entitlement catalog  
- Synthetic UAT tenants from PROD-S1C (must not collide with customer business ids)
