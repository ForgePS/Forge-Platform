## Root collections (name + count)

Counts from Firestore aggregation API.

| Collection | Count | Tenant keys (sample) | Drift | Delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| activityLogs | 18074 | businessId, organizationId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| qr_link_audit_events | 6697 | businessId, organizationId | STABLE | PARTIAL* |
| qr_link_versions | 5100 | businessId, organizationId | STABLE | PARTIAL* |
| lotoProcedures | 2539 | businessId, organizationId, tenantId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| qr_links | 2524 | businessId, organizationId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| assetRecords | 2489 | businessId, organizationId, companyId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| auth_audit_logs | 1198 | organizationId | STABLE | PARTIAL* |
| personnelRecords | 1097 | businessId, organizationId, companyId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| lotoLibraries | 275 | businessId, organizationId, tenantId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| companyVehicleDrivers | 201 | businessId, organizationId | SIGNIFICANT_DRIFT | DELTA_SAFE |
| workersCompAuditEvents | 121 | businessId, organizationId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| platformNotificationOutbox | 105 | businessId | STABLE | PARTIAL* |
| chemicalSafetyRecords | 104 | businessId, organizationId, companyId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| warehouseSafetyRecords | 102 | businessId, organizationId, companyId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| departments | 88 | organizationId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| sites | 27 | organizationId | STABLE | DELTA_SAFE |
| *(remaining 64 collections)* | *(see `.tmp-data-migration/dm-s0/collections.json`)* | | | |

\*Exact delta class for every collection is in machine evidence; table highlights largest volumes.

Full alphabetized list of all 80 root collection names is recorded in the DM-S0 machine summary and tooling output (gitignored). Names include industrial modules (LOTO, DOT, confined space, hot work, heights, electrical, cranes, machine/chemical/warehouse/manufacturing/contractor/process/environmental safety, WC family, training, forms, inspections, incidents, QR/scan, platform billing, etc.).

## Subcollections

| Parent | Subcollection | Path pattern | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| equipmentMigrationBatches | rows | `equipmentMigrationBatches/{docId}/rows` | Only nested pattern observed in sampled probes |

Bounded probe: 5 docs/collection. Historical nested collections not present in samples are still possible — DM-S1 should re-probe per collection with higher coverage for high-risk modules.

## Schema profiling

- Sample size per collection: up to 25 documents
- Field union + type classification (string/boolean/integer/double/null/timestamp/geopoint/reference/bytes/array/map)
- Notable drift: `companyVehicleDrivers` = **SIGNIFICANT_DRIFT**
- Most operational collections: **STABLE**

Sensitive values are not copied into committed docs.

## Firebase Auth

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Total users | 10 |
| Enabled | 10 |
| Disabled | 0 |
| Providers | `password` × 10 |
| MFA enrolled | 0 (none observed) |
| Business claim IDs | `business-1782553339499`, `business-forge-default` |
| Linkage | custom claims `businessIds` / `businessId` / `businesses` (+ optional Firestore user/personnel join in DM-S1) |

Auth user count is far below personnel record count → most workers are **not** Firebase Auth users.

## Storage

| Bucket | Purpose | Objects | Bytes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `forge-industrial-safety.firebasestorage.app` | Customer/app files | 9303 | 16,568,761,846 |
| `forge-industrial-safety-firestore-migration-20260811` | Firestore export/migration | 351 | 41,606,561 |
| `industrialsafety_data_export` | Export staging | 0 | 0 |
| `industrialsafety_data_migration` | Migration staging | 0 | 0 |
| `gcf-v2-*` | Functions infra | skipped deep list | — |

Customer path prefixes (prior + live): `module-attachments/`, `tenants/`, `dot-compliance/`, `certificates/`, `equipment-migrations/`, `training-imports/`, `dqf-exports/`.

## Realtime Database

**NOT USED** — shallow HTTPS probe returned HTTP 404 for default RTDB URL.

## Cloud Functions (cutover writers)

Active functions include (non-exhaustive of triggers): auth/password provisioning, billing/notification email, LOTO PDF parse, equipment migration/document writers, training import, QR/scan resolvers, form PDF sign, membership claim sync (`syncBusinessClaimsOnMembershipWrite`, `syncMyBusinessClaims`).

These must be inventoried for write-freeze in a later cutover sprint. **Not disabled in DM-S0.**

## Indexes

- Composite indexes observed: **92**
- Index field patterns confirm primary tenant query key `businessId` (+ `createdAt` sorts) on high-volume collections such as `activityLogs`.

## Security rules

Rules were not redeployed. Live rule text should be exported read-only in DM-S1 evidence packaging. Prior industrial program docs indicate business/membership scoped access; treat live rules as authoritative at cutover.

## Source vs prior code knowledge

| Class | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| LIVE_AND_CODE | Core industrial collections previously used in ind-11 extract waves |
| LIVE_ONLY | Several platform/billing/scan/WC satellite collections beyond early wave loaders |
| CODE_ONLY | None asserted without a live miss — DM-S0 enumerated live roots directly |

## Export bucket readiness

`FIRESTORE_EXPORT_BUCKET: READY`  
Preferred existing bucket: `forge-industrial-safety-firestore-migration-20260811`
