## Blocking CONDITIONS

1. Tip Drizzle industrial DDL still absent (`TARGET_SCHEMA: CONDITIONS`).
2. 14 archived domains with `implementationStatus: MISSING` (LOTO libraries/records, scan family, WC medical satellites, company vehicles, corrective actions).
3. Controlled Aurora import requires separate authorization after schema sprint.

## Verdict

**NOT READY** for production Aurora customer import.  
**READY** for reviewed, controlled AWS import planning once tip industrial DDL is applied and MISSING domains are either schema'd or explicitly excluded.
