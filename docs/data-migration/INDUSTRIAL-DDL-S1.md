# INDUSTRIAL-DDL-S1 — Target Schema Completion

**Checkpoint:** FORGE-DATA-MIGRATION INDUSTRIAL-DDL-S1  
**DM-S2 commit:** `3e6690a`  
**Migration:** `0040_industrial_domain_s1.sql` (after `0039_module_catalog_s2`)

## INDUSTRIAL_DDL_SOURCE

| Finding | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Tip Drizzle before this sprint | **genuinely missing** industrial domain DDL |
| Live IND-11 Aurora | attested tables (evidence/loaders) not tip-committed |
| Other branch thin ops | `industrial_ops_records` only (not used) |
| This sprint | **created tip DDL** `0040_industrial_domain_s1` |

## Gap resolution (former 14 MISSING)

| Domain | Classification | Target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| LOTO libraries / records (+ steps/energy/isolation/revisions) | LIVE_OPERATIONAL | `industrial_loto_*` |
| scan_* + QR scan events | LIVE_OPERATIONAL / AURORA_HISTORY | `industrial_scan_*`, `industrial_qr_link_scan_events` |
| Corrective actions | LIVE_OPERATIONAL | `industrial_corrective_actions` |
| WC medical / restrictions / carriers / work status | LIVE_OPERATIONAL (+ restricted medical RLS) | `industrial_workers_comp_*` |
| Fleet drivers/settings | LIVE_OPERATIONAL | `industrial_fleet_drivers`, `*_settings` |
| Fleet vehicles | CREATE_SCHEMA (no Firebase vehicle corpus; API-ready) | `industrial_fleet_vehicles` |
