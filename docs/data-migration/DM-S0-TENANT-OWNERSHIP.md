# DM-S0 Tenant Ownership

**Source project:** `forge-industrial-safety`  
**Rule:** Do not guess tenant ownership. Flag ambiguity.

## How tenant scoping works

Observed mechanisms (often combined on the same document):

| Mechanism | Fields / path | Prevalence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business id | `businessId` | Dominant on operational modules |
| Organization id | `organizationId` | Sites, departments, many modules |
| Company id | `companyId` | Personnel/assets/safety modules |
| Explicit tenant id | `tenantId` | Some LOTO families |
| Parent path | Storage paths `…/{businessId}/…` | Files |
| Auth claims | `businessIds` / `businessId` / `businesses` | Firebase Auth |

There is **no single universal key**. DM-S1 must implement a precedence policy, recommended:

1. `businessId` when present and `business-*`
2. else map `organizationId` via `organizations` / `platformBusinesses`
3. else `companyId` if unambiguously mapped
4. else quarantine

## Distinct source tenant keys observed

| SOURCE_TENANT_ID | Collections present (count of collections where key appeared) | Classification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `business-1782553339499` | 71 | Primary customer business (Producers) |
| `business-forge-default` | 25 | Platform/default business |
| `GLOBAL` | 2 (`ehsAuditTemplates`, `ehsAuditTemplateVersions`) | Shared/global template scope — **AMBIGUOUS for customer tenancy** |
| `Producers Rice Mill` | 1 (`auth_audit_logs`) | Display-name used as id — **AMBIGUOUS / HIGH** |

## Per-collection ownership (summary)

| COLLECTION class | TENANT_SCOPING_METHOD | UNSCOPED_RECORDS | AMBIGUOUS_RECORDS | NOTES |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Operational industrial modules (personnel, assets, LOTO, safety modules, WC, QR, training, forms, …) | Field `businessId` (+ often org/company) | 0 observed in samples | Possible mixed keys | Migrate filtered by authorized business ids |
| `sites`, `departments` | `organizationId` | 0 | Org→business map required | Facility inventory uses `sites` |
| `organizations`, `platformBusinesses` | Registry / platform | N/A (are the registry) | — | Not “customer orphans” |
| `platformSettings`, `super_admins`, billing templates | Platform | Platform-scoped | — | Not customer tenant data |
| `content_overrides` | No tenant key in sample | 3 docs | Treat as platform/global until proven | Review before load |
| `auth_audit_logs` | mostly `organizationId`; one display-name businessId | — | **yes** (`Producers Rice Mill`) | Normalize before import |
| EHS audit templates with `GLOBAL` | Literal `GLOBAL` businessId | — | **yes** | Shared library vs tenant copy decision |

## Facilities / locations

| Source | Count | Tenant link | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sites` | 27 | `organizationId` | Primary facility/site records |
| `departments` | 88 | `organizationId` | Areas/departments under org |

No separate root `facilities` / `plants` collection observed. Target mapping likely `sites` → facilities/sites; `departments` → areas/organizations.

## Migration blockers (ownership)

| ID | Severity | Issue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OWN-1 | HIGH | `businessId = "Producers Rice Mill"` on some `auth_audit_logs` (non-canonical id) |
| OWN-2 | MEDIUM | `businessId = "GLOBAL"` on EHS audit template collections |
| OWN-3 | MEDIUM | Dual keys (`businessId` vs `organizationId`-only on sites/departments) require join table |
| OWN-4 | INFO | Auth users (10) << personnelRecords (1097) — membership migration is not 1:1 with Auth |

No large unscoped customer operational collections were found without any tenant-like field in samples. Platform/registry collections are intentionally unscoped.
