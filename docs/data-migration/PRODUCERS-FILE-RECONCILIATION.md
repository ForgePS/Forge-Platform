## Closeout consistency (CAI-S1R-UAT-CLOSEOUT)

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |

| TOTAL_ACCOUNTED | **9305** |

### Attachment storage_key alignment

File promotion wrote objects under `tenants/{liveTenantId}/…` with `business-1782553339499` → live UUID substitution inside the key. Imported `industrial_attachments.storage_key` initially retained Firebase-relative keys. Closeout remapped **13/13** Producers attachment keys to the promoted scheme; S3 HEAD **PASS** for all samples (PDF + image content types).
