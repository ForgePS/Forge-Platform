## Notes

- Full-package idempotent upsert dry-run against live Producers tenant (existing tooling).
- Planned inserts (48) cover new history/audit/scan/event rows plus any newly resolvable operational children relative to current Aurora state.
- QR orphan skip count unchanged at 2576 (SOURCE_ORPHAN classification retained).
- Identity collections (`tenants` / `users` / `users+memberships`) remain non-import files.
- Attachment storage keys will be remapped to promoted `tenants/{liveTenantId}/…` form post-apply if the running image still emits Firebase-relative keys; helper `promoteStorageKeyForLiveTenant` added in repo for subsequent importer builds.
