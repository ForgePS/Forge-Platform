**Date (UTC):** 2026-08-14  
**Producers tenant:** `019ff7d0-c20f-7659-81e4-c0cd68e23262`  
**Isolation tenant:** `aaaaaaaa-bbbb-4ccc-8ddd-eeeeeeeeeeee`

## Application / API (Platform Admin support context)

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PLATFORM_ADMIN_CONTEXT | **EXPLICIT** | `/api/v1/auth/me` → `isPlatformAdmin=true`, `accessMode=PLATFORM_ADMIN_SUPPORT` |
| AUDITED | **YES** | Support actions require platform admin principal; admin path is explicit support mode (not ordinary membership of every tenant) |
| GLOBAL_ENTITLEMENT_BYPASS | **NO** | Industrial routes still require product entitlement checks; support mode is not silent entitlement grant for all tenants as members |
| CROSS_TENANT_LIST | **DENIED** | `GET /tenants/{OTHER}/industrial/personnel` → 200 with **0** rows |
| CROSS_TENANT_DETAIL | **DENIED** | `GET /tenants/{OTHER}/industrial/sites/{producersSiteId}` → **404 NOT_FOUND** |
| CROSS_TENANT_DOCUMENT | **DENIED** | RLS app-role: attachments count 0 under OTHER tenant GUC |
| CROSS_TENANT_QR | **DENIED** | RLS app-role: `qr_links` count 0 under OTHER |
| CROSS_TENANT_WC | **DENIED** | RLS app-role: WC cases count 0 under OTHER |
| CROSS_TENANT_WRITE | **DENIED** (Producers rows) | Cannot read/update Producers site under OTHER path (404). Writes under OTHER path create OTHER-tenant rows only (synthetic probe rows removed). |

## Database RLS (forge_app)
