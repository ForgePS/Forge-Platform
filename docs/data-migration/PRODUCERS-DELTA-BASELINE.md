# PRODUCERS — Delta baseline (CONTROLLED-AURORA-IMPORT-S1R)

**Status:** RECORDED (informational) — **DELTA_SYNC NOT RUN**  
**Date (UTC):** 2026-08-14  

## Baseline anchors

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Source package | DM-S2 V2 `aws-import-run-v2` |
| Package S3 URI | `s3://forge-production-imports-511343547817-us-east-1/controlled-import-s1/aws-import-run-v2/aws-import` |
| Initial AWS import run | `cai-s1-apply2-20260813T213639Z` |
| Remediation run | `cai-s1r-apply2-20260814T110922Z` |
| Remediation release SHA | `75e1194bb47af1ad80c83353265b121594427257` |
| Schema tip | `0040_industrial_domain_s1` |
| Live tenant | `019ff7d0-c20f-7659-81e4-c0cd68e23262` |
| Storage baseline bucket | `forge-production-documents-511343547817-us-east-1` |
| Storage baseline prefix | `tenants/019ff7d0-c20f-7659-81e4-c0cd68e23262/` |
| Staging retained | `s3://forge-production-imports-511343547817-us-east-1/storage/source/` |
| Initial AWS import completion (remediation) | `2026-08-14T11:13:14.405Z` |
| File promotion completion | `2026-08-14T11:37Z` (approx; see promotion summary artifact) |

## Watermark strategy

| Domain | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| Firestore collections | Compare `_migration.updateTime` / export generation against package extract timestamp |
| Storage | Compare object etag/size under staging vs Firebase bucket listing after freeze |
| Operational Aurora | Prefer migration id-map + source_document_id idempotency |

## Readiness gates (CAI-S1R-UAT-CLOSEOUT)

| Gate | Result |
| --- | --- |
| DELTA_BASELINE | **PASS** |
| DELTA_STRATEGY_DOCUMENTED | **PASS** |
| DELTA_UNSAFE_COLLECTION_STRATEGY | **PASS** |

## Current source drift (measure only — do not apply)

Firebase remained live during import. Exact NEW/UPDATED/DELETED counts require a fresh Firebase extract vs immutable package — **not executed in this sprint** (informational only).

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| NEW_SOURCE_DOCS | NOT MEASURED (Firebase still live) |
| UPDATED_SOURCE_DOCS | NOT MEASURED |
| DELETED_SOURCE_DOCS | NOT MEASURED |
| NEW_STORAGE_OBJECTS | NOT MEASURED |
| UPDATED_STORAGE_OBJECTS | NOT MEASURED |
| DELETED_STORAGE_OBJECTS | NOT MEASURED |
| DELTA_UNSAFE_COLLECTION_CHANGES | NOT MEASURED |
| CURRENT_SOURCE_DRIFT | **PRESENT (expected)** — Firebase remained authoritative; quantify in next authorized delta sprint |

## Delta-unsafe collections (from DM-S2)

| Collection | Final delta strategy |
| --- | --- |
| content_overrides | EXCLUDE / manual review |
| documentAccessEvents | EXCLUDE (audit stream) |
| personnelRosterImportSettings | EXCLUDE_APPROVED pattern |
| platformBillingNotifications | PLATFORM / exclude from customer delta |
| qr_link_scan_events | APPEND-only with care; do not rewrite history blindly |

DELTA_SYNC: **COMPLETE (CAI-S2)** — see `PRODUCERS-DELTA-READINESS-CAI-S2.md`  
FIREBASE_WRITE_FREEZE: **NOT RUN**  
Next authorized phase only: **WRITE FREEZE + MICRO-DELTA** (not started).
