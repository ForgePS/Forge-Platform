# DM-S1 Identity Mapping

**Source:** Firebase Auth + Firestore personnel / memberships  
**Sprint:** DM-S1 (metadata extract only — no Cognito create)

## Headline

| Population | Count (DM-S0 baseline) | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firebase Auth users | 10 | Interactive app operators (password provider) |
| `personnelRecords` | ~1097 | Worker / employee domain records |

**Personnel ≠ Auth users.** Do not create Cognito identities for all personnel.

## Relationship classes

| Class | Definition | Migration implication |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PERSONNEL_AND_AUTH | Personnel record linked to Firebase UID (email/UID join) | Candidate Cognito user + industrial_personnel |
| AUTH_ONLY | Auth user without personnel row | Platform/admin or membership-only identity |
| PERSONNEL_ONLY | Personnel without Auth user | Domain record only — **no Cognito** |
| UNKNOWN | Insufficient join evidence | Quarantine identity linking |

## Auth metadata extracted (safe)

Included: `firebaseUid`, `email`, `emailVerified`, `disabled`, `providerIds`, `createdAt`, `lastSignInAt`, business claims summary.

**Excluded:** password hashes, salts, tokens, refresh tokens, private credential material.

Firebase UID is preserved permanently as `legacy source identity` for later Cognito link tables.

## Join strategy (later sprints — not executed in DM-S1)

1. Prefer explicit UID fields on membership / organization_users / platformUsers.  
2. Else email match (case-normalized) between Auth and personnel.  
3. Else PERSONNEL_ONLY.

## Cognito policy

| Action | DM-S1 | Future authorized sprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extract Auth metadata | YES | — |
| Create Cognito users for Auth population | NO | When authorized |
| Create Cognito users for all personnel | **NEVER by default** | Explicit product decision required |
| Seed Aurora industrial_personnel | NO | Transform/import sprint |

## Output

Logical package: `auth/auth-metadata.ndjson` (gitignored under `.tmp-data-migration/`).
