# DM-S0 Cutover Risks

**Source:** `forge-industrial-safety`  
**Sprint:** Inventory only — no freeze/export/import executed  

## Critical / High

| ID | Sev | Finding | Cutover impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R1 | HIGH | Active Cloud Functions can still write customer data (imports, document uploads, claim sync, emails, scan completions) | Requires coordinated write-freeze before final delta |
| R2 | HIGH | Ambiguous tenant keys (`Producers Rice Mill`, `GLOBAL`) | Bad tenant assignment if loaded naively |
| R3 | HIGH | Industrial target DDL not in monorepo tip migrations through `0038` | Cannot safely load industrial domains to production until schema package confirmed |
| R4 | HIGH | Storage ~15.4 GiB / 9.3k objects | Long-running copy; needs integrity checksums and resume |
| R5 | MEDIUM | Auth users (10) vs personnel (1097) | Most employees are not interactive Auth users; avoid over-creating Cognito accounts |
| R6 | MEDIUM | Dual scoping (`businessId` vs `organizationId`-only sites/departments) | Join errors → orphan facilities |
| R7 | MEDIUM | Large audit streams (`activityLogs` 18k+, QR audit 6k+) | Delta noise; may need archive strategy |
| R8 | MEDIUM | `companyVehicleDrivers` significant schema drift | Transform fragility |
| R9 | LOW | Nested subcollections rare in samples (`equipmentMigrationBatches/rows` only) | Residual risk of missed nests |
| R10 | LOW | Delta-unsafe collections lack updatedAt | Need full re-extract under freeze |
| R11 | INFO | SES/email still sandbox on AWS side (separate program) | Invitation/recovery email after cutover |
| R12 | INFO | Export buckets already exist | Low risk to run later authorized export |

## Delta readiness

- **DELTA_SAFE:** majority of operational collections (updatedAt-like fields present)
- **DELTA_UNSAFE:** `content_overrides`, `documentAccessEvents`, `personnelRosterImportSettings`, `platformBillingNotifications`, `qr_link_scan_events`
- Final cutover still needs freeze because Functions/integrations continue to write

## External / integration writers (do not modify in DM-S0)

| Integration / surface | Writes to | Consideration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile / web industrial app | Firestore + Storage | Primary live writer |
| Cloud Functions (imports, PDF, QR, claims) | Firestore / Storage / Auth claims / email | Freeze list |
| Equipment migration batches | Firestore + Storage | Disable before final extract |
| Training import jobs | Firestore + Storage | |
| Billing/notification email functions | Outbox + external email | |
| Prior AWS ind-11 rehearsal loads | Aurora development only | Not production customer cutover |

## Orphan references

Full referential integrity scans were **not** executed in DM-S0 (cost/control).  
DM-S1 must run explicit orphan reports for:

- `siteId` / facility references  
- personnel references on incidents/training/LOTO  
- Storage paths missing objects  
- Auth UIDs missing membership docs  

## Recommended freeze order (future sprint)

1. Disable/pause import & migration functions  
2. Quiesce interactive admin imports  
3. Firestore export to verified bucket  
4. Auth metadata package  
5. Storage metadata + copy  
6. AWS transform/load  
7. Only then DNS/customer traffic (PROD-S2 — not authorized now)
