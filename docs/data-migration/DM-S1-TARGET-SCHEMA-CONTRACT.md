# DM-S1 Target Schema Contract

**Program:** FORGE-DATA-MIGRATION  
**Sprint:** DM-S1  
**Source project:** `forge-industrial-safety`  
**Hard gate:** Resolve what “Industrial target schema not present in monorepo tip migrations through `0038`” means, and classify every operational source module.

## What DM-S0 meant

Monorepo tip `packages/database/drizzle/` through `0038_mk_s21_security_hardening.sql` contains **platform SaaS / NERIS / RMS / CAD / import / billing** DDL only.

It does **not** contain:

- `industrial_*` domain tables
- `qr_links`
- `platform_documents` / `platform_document_versions` (industrial document control)

Those industrial entities were applied / loaded in **prior IND-11 development Aurora** (live evidence + ECS loaders), but **are not first-class Drizzle migrations on this tip**. Therefore AWS customer import remains blocked until an authorized schema sprint re-commits / applies the industrial DDL package to the target environment.

**Do not assume Aurora for every module.** Verified industrial persistence intent:

| Service | Role for Industrial |
| --- | --- |
| Aurora PostgreSQL | Primary operational SoT for industrial modules (live evidence) |
| S3 object storage | Document / attachment blobs (`tenants/{tenantId}/documents/...`) |
| Cognito | Interactive operators (Auth identity) — **not** all personnel |
| DynamoDB | **Not used** for industrial modules |

## STATUS legend

| STATUS | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| CONFIRMED | Target entity attested (live Aurora evidence and/or tip migration) |
| MISSING | Documented gap / no target — `TARGET_SCHEMA_GAP` |
| AMBIGUOUS | Loaded or intended, but exact tip/table name not attested |
| NOT_MIGRATED | Intentionally out of prior loads or policy-deferred |

## TARGET_SCHEMA_GAP list (blocks AWS import)

1. `lotoLibraries` / `lotoRecords`
2. `scan_*` / `qr_link_scan_events` target tables
3. `correctiveActionRecords`
4. Workers Comp medical / restrictions / carriers satellites
5. `companyVehicleDrivers*` durable schema
6. Industrial DDL **re-commit to tip migrations** (even for CONFIRMED live tables) before production customer import

## Blocking rule

Any operational collection containing customer records **must** have STATUS=CONFIRMED (and tip-applied DDL in the target environment) before AWS import. DM-S1 may still extract logically. **AWS IMPORT remains blocked.**

## Persistence architecture note

Tip `facilities` (`0028_mk_s1_tenant_domain.sql`) is the **SaaS tenant facility** model — **not** the industrial site SoT. Industrial sites map to `industrial_sites` (live), not tip `facilities`.
