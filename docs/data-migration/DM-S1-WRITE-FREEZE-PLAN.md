# DM-S1 Write-Freeze Plan

**Sprint:** DM-S1  
**Status:** PLAN ONLY — **do not disable Cloud Functions in DM-S1**

Source inventory from DM-S0 (28 listed helpers/writers). Exact pause mechanics belong to cutover sprint.

## Writer inventory (cutover-relevant)

| FUNCTION | WRITES_TO | TRIGGER | CAN_BE_PAUSED | CUTOVER_ACTION | RESTART_ACTION | RISK |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Equipment migration / document writers | Firestore `equipmentMigrationBatches` (+ rows), Storage | HTTP / callable / Storage | YES | Pause import + migration functions; drain batches | Redeploy / re-enable after AWS SoT | HIGH — mutates equipment docs |
| Training import jobs | Firestore training + Storage | HTTP / job | YES | Pause training import | Re-enable | HIGH |
| LOTO PDF parse | Firestore LOTO + Storage | Storage finalize | YES | Pause PDF parse CF | Re-enable | MEDIUM |
| Form PDF / sign helpers | Firestore forms + Storage | callable / Storage | YES | Pause | Re-enable | MEDIUM |
| QR / scan resolvers / completions | Firestore `qr_*` / scan events | HTTPS / callable | PARTIAL | Pause writers; keep read resolvers if needed for customer traffic (PROD-S2 not authorized) | Re-enable | HIGH for scan streams |
| `syncBusinessClaimsOnMembershipWrite` | Auth custom claims | Firestore membership write | YES | Pause after membership freeze | Re-enable | HIGH — Auth claim drift |
| `syncMyBusinessClaims` | Auth claims | callable | YES | Pause | Re-enable | HIGH |
| Auth / password provisioning helpers | Auth users | Auth / admin | YES | Freeze admin provisioning | Re-enable | HIGH |
| Billing / notification email + outbox | Firestore outbox + email | scheduled / write | YES | Pause outbound; drain outbox | Re-enable | MEDIUM |
| Platform notification writers | Firestore notifications | write / schedule | YES | Pause | Re-enable | LOW–MED |
| Interactive web/mobile industrial app | Firestore + Storage | user traffic | PARTIAL | Quiesce admin imports; full traffic cut is PROD-S2 | Restore | CRITICAL if left live during final extract |

## Recommended future freeze order (not executed now)

1. Pause import & migration Cloud Functions  
2. Quiesce interactive admin import UIs  
3. Pause claim-sync writers  
4. Native Firestore export + logical extract under quiet window  
5. Auth metadata package  
6. Storage copy (later sprint)  
7. AWS transform/load  
8. DNS / customer traffic only when PROD-S2 authorized

## DELTA_UNSAFE collections (freeze / re-extract strategy)

| Collection | Later cutover strategy |
| --- | --- |
| content_overrides | FULL_REEXTRACT under freeze |
| documentAccessEvents | FULL_REEXTRACT or ARCHIVE_ONLY |
| personnelRosterImportSettings | FULL_REEXTRACT |
| platformBillingNotifications | FULL_REEXTRACT or EXCLUDE_WITH_APPROVAL |
| qr_link_scan_events | WRITE_FREEZE + FULL_REEXTRACT (or ARCHIVE_ONLY if not migrating scans) |

DELTA_SAFE collections may use SOURCE_HASH_COMPARE / APPEND_ONLY after freeze validation — final cutover still requires freeze because Functions continue to write.
