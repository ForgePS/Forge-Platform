**Target:** 0 failed / 0 skipped at Definition of Done

## Current architecture-stop coverage

| Suite | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `@forge/imports` unit smoke | Required green for skeleton |
| API / RLS / Playwright / a11y | Planned — not run until implementation sprints |

## Implementation sprint checklist

- [ ] Unit: formats, validation rules, duplicates, transforms  
- [ ] Integration: staging tables + RLS  
- [ ] API contract tests for all `/api/v1/import/*` routes  
- [ ] Tenant isolation API matrix  
- [ ] Duplicate action matrix  
- [ ] Rollback safe / unsafe  
- [ ] Performance large CSV  
- [ ] Playwright Import Center  
- [ ] Accessibility (axe + keyboard wizard)
