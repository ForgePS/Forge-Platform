**Date:** 2026-07-28  
**Method:** Playwright + `@axe-core/playwright` (wcag2a / wcag2aa / wcag22aa tags) against live CloudFront  
**Suite:** `apps/configuration-e2e/tests/accessibility.spec.ts`  
**Evidence:** `docs/testing/evidence/config-final-acceptance/playwright-config-e2e.log`  
**Manual WCAG matrix:** `docs/testing/configuration-platform-accessibility.md`

## Automated results

| Surface | Critical | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creator Studio `/studio/branding` | 0 | PASS (axe critical empty) |
| Tenant Admin `/studio/branding` | 0 | PASS (axe critical empty) |

Playwright a11y+smoke suite: **5 passed / 0 failed / 0 skipped**.

## Classification of remaining findings

| Finding | Severity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| JSON editor not announced as code editor to SR | Medium | Shared textarea; add aria description |
| Version timeline / compare table semantics | Medium | Prefer table headers / list roles |
| Full keyboard matrix for schedule/rollback dialogs | Medium | Manual pass not exhaustively recorded |
| Contrast under forced colors / 200% zoom | Low | Not separately measured this sprint |
| Drag-drop alternatives | Low | N/A — rich builders not shipped |

## Manual checks (spot)

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Keyboard tab through studio chrome | Partial (smoke only) |
| Visible focus | Relies on browser/default CSS |
| Accessible dialogs | Studio uses inline panels more than modal dialogs |
| Zoom / responsive | Tenant Admin + Creator static layouts load on mobile viewport not fully re-tested |

**Verdict:** Automated critical bar PASS; full WCAG 2.2 AA manual matrix remains a Medium residual risk → acceptance limitation if ACCEPTED requires exhaustive manual evidence.
