# Import Platform S8 — Accessibility

**Document:** `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-accessibility.md`  
**Surface:** `@forge/import-center` in Creator Console + Tenant Admin  
**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Status:** Closeout run **FAILED**; authorized axe/keyboard evidence **NOT_VERIFIED**

## Honest baseline

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Playwright + axe Import Center suite | **ADDED** — `apps/configuration-e2e/tests/import-center-s8.spec.ts` (axe critical/serious on dashboard; landmarks) |
| Recorded run | **FAIL** — 7 tests ran: 4 passed, 3 failed; authorized dashboard was unavailable and axe did not run |
| Full keyboard-only workflow | **NOT_VERIFIED** |
| Unit tests | Do not prove a11y |

Evidence: docs/testing/evidence/import-platform/s8-playwright-import-center.json.

DEF-S8-005 remains **OPEN**: the dashboard axe precondition failed, and no full keyboard-only create-upload-execute workflow is covered.

Track under LIM-IMP-011 (and LIM-IMP-008 for narrow screens).

## Requirements (must pass before closing LIM-IMP-011)

### Keyboard

| Requirement | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Reachability | All interactive controls reachable via Tab / Shift+Tab |
| Activation | Enter/Space; no keyboard trap |
| Focus order | Logical; focus visible |
| Execution monitor | Polling must not steal focus every 3s |

### Screen reader / semantics

| Requirement | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Headings | One logical h1 per view |
| Labels | Associated labels on inputs |
| Status | Async status announced |
| Errors | Not color-only |
| Disabled controls | Reason available to AT |

### axe / WCAG target

| Target | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| WCAG 2.2 AA (practical subset) | axe on dashboard, mapping, security/quarantine, execution, results |
| Critical/Serious | Zero open for acceptance |
| Moderate | Triaged |

### Responsive

| Viewport | Expectation |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop / tablet | Primary supported |
| Narrow phone | Residual LIM-IMP-008 if mapping constrained |

## Suite vs full workflow

Current Playwright a11y case is **dashboard surface only** — not full import workflow keyboard tour.

## Exit criteria

LIM-IMP-011 → CLOSED only with attached browser evidence (axe JSON + notes). Until then **OPEN**.
