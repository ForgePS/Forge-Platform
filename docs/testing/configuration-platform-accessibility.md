## Manual WCAG 2.2 AA checklist (spot / release readiness)

| Criterion | Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1.3.1 Info and Relationships | Studio chrome landmarks / headings | Partial | Branding module structure OK in smoke; JSON editor lacks code-editor semantics |
| 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum) | Primary text/controls on studio | Partial | Default theme; forced-colors / high-contrast not re-measured |
| 1.4.4 Resize text | 200% zoom usable | Not fully re-tested | Layout loads; dense JSON panels may clip |
| 2.1.1 Keyboard | Tab through studio nav + module actions | Partial | Smoke keyboard path only; schedule/rollback dialogs not exhaustively matrixed |
| 2.4.3 Focus Order | Logical tab order in branding / terminology | Partial | Relies on DOM order |
| 2.4.7 Focus Visible | Visible focus on interactive controls | Partial | Browser/default CSS; no custom focus ring audit |
| 3.2.2 On Input | No unexpected context change on field edit | Pass (spot) | Draft save is explicit action |
| 4.1.2 Name, Role, Value | Controls named for AT | Partial | Textareas / compare tables need stronger roles |
| 4.1.3 Status Messages | Save/publish/error announcements | Partial | API errors surface in UI; live region coverage not proven |

## Residual findings

| Finding | Severity |
| --- | --- |
| JSON editor not announced as code editor | Medium |
| Version timeline / compare table semantics | Medium |
| Full keyboard matrix for schedule / rollback | Medium |
| Contrast under forced colors / 200% zoom | Low |
| Drag-drop alternatives | Low (N/A — rich builders not shipped) |

## Totals

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Automated critical failures | **0** |
| Automated suite failed | **0** |
| Manual WCAG matrix complete | **No** (spot / partial) |

**Verdict:** Automated critical bar PASS. Manual WCAG 2.2 AA matrix remains incomplete → acceptance limitation.
