# Import Platform S8 — Concurrency

**Document:** `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-concurrency.md`  
**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Status:** **PARTIAL** — three live jobs completed across two seeded tenants; safe maximum remains unverified

## Deployed worker capacity (config)

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Worker CPU / memory | 256 / 512 |
| Path | SQS → ECS (`RETAIN_SQS_ECS_WORKER_PATH`) |
| Aurora | serverless writer |

The live run used worker TD `:26` and API TD `:42`.

## Live measured run

| Scenario | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Concurrent jobs same tenant | **VERIFIED** — two 200-row jobs completed, 200/200 successful each |
| Concurrent jobs across tenants | **PARTIAL** — three jobs across two tenants completed; the supplied fixture has only two tenants |
| Cross-tenant status access | **VERIFIED** — all three other-tenant probes returned 404 with no job data |
| Parallel execution wall time | 13,202 ms for all three jobs to reach terminal status |
| Worker durations | 7,032 ms; 7,025 ms; 4,031 ms |
| Lock contention / connection saturation | **NOT_VERIFIED** — lock waits were not captured; Aurora connections peaked at 9 |
| Safe max in-flight jobs | **NOT_VERIFIED** — freeze lists as placeholder |

All 600 synthetic rows completed without row errors. Shared performance telemetry reached worker and Aurora CPU saturation, so this smoke does not establish a production concurrency limit.

Evidence: `docs/testing/evidence/import-platform/s8-concurrency-live.json`.

## Freeze honesty

`Supported concurrency limits` in `import-platform-freeze.md` remain **NOT_VERIFIED**.
