# Import Platform S8 — Test Plan

**Document:** `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-test-plan.md`  
**Goal:** Production hardening evidence without inventing scale/E2E results

## In scope

1. Unit coverage for production guards, stuck thresholds, batch recommendation  
2. DLQ ops script safety (inspect / dry-run; no Body leakage)  
3. Alarm/baseline health checks  
4. ADR + limitation register consistency  
5. Permission matrix execution (API) where environment available  
6. Aurora multi-size performance **protocol** (execution may be PENDING)  
7. Accessibility requirements documentation (suite may be pending)  
8. Security regression: Outcome B block; no override; FORCE RLS unchanged  

## Out of scope

- Product adapters  
- Step Functions activation tests as live path  
- Claiming cross-region DR  
- Fabricating Aurora 250k throughput numbers  

## Test suites

### A. Unit — `@forge/imports`

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| Reference scanner allowed in `development` / `testing` / `local` | `ok: true` |
| Reference scanner blocked in `staging` / `production` / `govcloud-*` | `IMPORT_SCANNER_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` |
| Non-reference provider allowed in production | `ok: true` |
| Stuck SCANNING beyond 15m | `isStuckImportJob` true |
| Terminal statuses | not stuck |
| `S8_BATCH_RECOMMENDATION` | default 50, max 500 |

File: `packages/imports/src/s8-hardening.unit.test.ts` (+ prior S1–S6 suites).

### B. Unit — `@forge/import-center`

Router, permissions, tenant cache clear, download dispose helpers, fixtures (existing S7 suite).

### C. Ops / AWS (controlled)

| Case | Expected |
| --- | --- |
| DLQ inspect | Runs; prints attributes only; depth documented |
| Alarms | DLQ + backlog state recorded |
| ECS revisions | Documented vs baseline |

### D. Permission matrix

Execute `docs/imports/s8-permission-test-matrix.md` against a non-prod API with fixture users.

### E. Performance protocol

Follow `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-performance.md`:

- Keep S5 in-process 500-row smoke as lower bound evidence  
- Aurora matrix sizes (e.g. 500 / 5k / 50k / 250k) as **required protocol** with `PENDING_CONTROLLED_RUN` until executed  

### F. Security

See `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-security.md`.

### G. Accessibility

See `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-accessibility.md` — keyboard + axe requirements; Playwright suite not yet greenfield.

## Environments

| Env | Scanner expectation |
| --- | --- |
| development / testing | Reference provider allowed |
| staging / production-like | Reference provider blocked |

## Exit criteria (honest)

S8 may be accepted with documented PENDING items if:

- Guards + ADRs + runbooks complete  
- No false scale claims  
- LIM register reflects MITIGATED/DEFERRED correctly  
- Remaining evidence listed in results doc  

## Results

Record in `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-results.md`.
