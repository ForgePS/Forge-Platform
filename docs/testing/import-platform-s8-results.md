# Import Platform S8 — Test Results

**Document:** `docs/testing/import-platform-s8-results.md`  
**Date:** 2026-07-29  
**Honesty rule:** Only record verified evidence. Do **not** invent Aurora/E2E browser pass counts.

## Summary verdict

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Unit production guards / stuck / batch | **VERIFIED** — `@forge/imports` 49 passed (incl. S8 hardening) |
| Import Center unit | **VERIFIED** — 9 passed (incl. banner export) |
| DLQ inspect (development) | **VERIFIED empty** + tooling exercised |
| CloudWatch import alarms (backlog/DLQ) | **VERIFIED OK** |
| Import CloudWatch dashboards (CLI put) | **VERIFIED published** (5 dashboards) |
| ADRs (malware Outcome B, SFN Option B) | **VERIFIED** accepted decision docs |
| Aurora multi-size / 250k | **NOT EXECUTED** — protocol only |
| Playwright / browser a11y E2E | **NOT EXECUTED** — requirements documented |
| Full live permission HTTP matrix | **PENDING** controlled-env evidence |
| ECS RLS re-verify this session | **VERIFIED** — 45/45 passed (`docs/testing/evidence/import-platform/s8-rls-verify.json`) |
| S8 CLI alarms (queue-age / worker / scanner-blocked) | **CREATED** (INSUFFICIENT_DATA until metrics flow) |
| S8 API/worker/frontend image deploy | **VERIFIED** — API `:40` / worker `:25` / frontends invalidated |

## Verified evidence

### 1. Unit guards (`@forge/imports`)

Source: `packages/imports/src/s8-hardening.unit.test.ts` + `production-guards.ts`

| Assertion | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Reference scanner allowed in development/testing | Covered |
| Reference scanner blocked in staging/production/govcloud-production | Covered |
| Non-reference provider allowed in production | Covered |
| Stuck job threshold for SCANNING | Covered |
| `S8_BATCH_RECOMMENDATION` default 50 / max 500 | Covered |

Prior package suites (S1–S6) remain regression baseline. S8 baseline inventory re-ran `@forge/imports` at **44 passed** and `@forge/import-center` at **8 passed** (2026-07-29 kickoff counts). Re-record exact counts on acceptance CI run if they change.

### 2. DLQ ops

Tool: `scripts/import-dlq-ops.mjs`  
Baseline: development imports queue / DLQ approximate messages **0 / 0**.  
Inspect mode is the safe default; Body redaction is by design.

### 3. Alarms

| Alarm | State at baseline |
| --- | --- |
| `forge-development-alarm-imports-backlog` | OK |
| `forge-development-alarm-importsdlq` | OK |

### 4. Architecture decisions

| ADR | Decision | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Malware provider | Outcome B production block | ACCEPTED |
| Step Functions | Option B keep SQS→ECS | ACCEPTED |

### 5. Schema / path

| Item | Verified |
| --- | --- |
| Migrations through `0027` | Journal + S6 evidence |
| Operational path API→SQS→ECS | Live: no import state machine |
| FORCE RLS on import tables | Migrations 0022–0027 |

## Remains controlled-env evidence (PENDING)

| Item | Why pending |
| --- | --- |
| Aurora multi-tenant matrix (500 / 5k / 50k / 250k) | No controlled run executed in S8 docs phase — see performance doc |
| Full HTTP permission matrix against live roles | Needs fixture users in target env |
| Browser a11y (keyboard + axe) | Playwright suite not greenfield |
| Tenant-switch cache browser proof | LIM-IMP-012 |
| Protected download browser proof | LIM-IMP-013 |
| Presigned URL disposal browser proof | LIM-IMP-014 |
| Controlled Aurora PITR + S3 version restore drill | Backup runbook placeholders |

## Explicit non-results (do not cite as pass)

- Aurora **250k** row import throughput  
- Multi-AZ / cross-region RTO measurements  
- “Playwright 100% a11y pass”  
- Product adapter E2E  
- Live Step Functions execution  

## Sign-off

| Role | Name | Date | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Engineering | | | Attach CI logs when available |
| Ops | | | Confirm alarm/DLQ snapshot |
| Acceptance | | | May accept with PENDING list |
