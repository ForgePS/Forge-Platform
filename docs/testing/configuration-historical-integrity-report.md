## Results

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Prior config version readable after newer publish | PASS |
| Published versions immutable (409 on patch) | PASS |
| Old terminology payload retained on version id | PASS |
| Old dropdown / forms / workflows / custom fields as **config version JSON** | PASS (version store) |
