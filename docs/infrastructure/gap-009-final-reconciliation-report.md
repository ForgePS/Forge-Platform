# GAP-009 — Final Reconciliation Report

**Decision:** `RECONCILED`  
**Date:** 2026-07-27  
**Approver:** Jeremy Powell, Founder, Forge Public Safety (APPROVED 2026-07-27)  
**Phase 4:** Not started

---

## 1. Executive summary

GAP-009 is closed. The Data stack no longer attempts to create `forge-development-secrets-database-app`. Strategy A (`Secret.fromSecretNameV2` with `importExistingAppSecret=true`) is live. Exclusive `cdk deploy ForgeData` completed with **no changes**. A subsequent tag-only CloudFormation update cleared the prior `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` status to **`UPDATE_COMPLETE`** without modifying the application secret value or ARN. API/RMS remain healthy; ECS `:16` still references the app secret; RLS probe confirms `forge_app` + FORCE RLS; tenant-isolation and Phase 3 smoke passed.

## 2. Final decision

| Decision | Selected |
| --- | --- |
| **RECONCILED** | **Yes** |
| RECONCILED_WITH_LIMITATIONS | No |
| NOT_RECONCILED | No |

---

## 3. Root cause

Application secret existed outside CloudFormation with the same name Data CDK tried to create → `AlreadyExists` → `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`.

---

## 4. Selected strategy

**Strategy A — import by name** (`fromSecretNameV2`) when `database.importExistingAppSecret=true` (development).

---

## 5. CDK implementation

- Config flag + `ForgeDatabase` import branch  
- Protection tests  
- Compute continues name lookup (no AppDbSecret export)

---

## 6–9. Secret ownership / before-after

| Item | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ownership | External | External (referenced by CDK; not CFN-created) |
| ARN | `…database-app-SknUu5` | **Unchanged** |
| LastChangedDate | 2026-07-26T15:30:16-05:00 | **Unchanged** |
| CFN AppDbSecret | Absent (failed create rolled back) | **Absent** |

---

## 10–11. ECS / Aurora / CloudFormation

| Area | Result |
| --- | --- |
| ECS | `:16` HEALTHY; `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN` → app secret name |
| Aurora | `forge-development-rds-aurora` **available**; not replaced |
| CFN | CDK deploy **no changes**; tag update → **UPDATE_COMPLETE** (2026-07-27T12:39:56Z) |

---

## 12. Deployment result

1. `cdk deploy ForgeData --exclusively --require-approval never` → **✅ no changes** (~28s)  
2. `update-stack --use-previous-template` + `Gap009ReconciledAt` tag → **UPDATE_COMPLETE** (cleared stale rollback status; no secret create)

---

## 13–20. Verification

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| API health | **200** |
| RMS | **200** |
| Runtime role | **`forge_app`** (`phase2-verify-rls.mjs` exit 0) |
| FORCE RLS | **PASS** (same probe) |
| Tenant isolation | **7/7 PASS** |
| Phase 3 smoke | **3/3 PASS** (review, scenario 1, scenario 10) |
| CloudWatch api-5xx family | **OK** |
| CloudTrail | **IsLogging true** |

## 21. Evidence artifacts

`docs/compliance/soc2/evidence/gap-009/` — approval-record, before/after state, cdk-diff-summary, synth-secret-resources, this report.

Plan: `docs/infrastructure/gap-009-data-secret-reconciliation-plan.md`

---

## 22. Known limitations

1. Application secret remains **externally owned** (not CFN-lifecycle-managed) in development — by design.  
2. Greenfield envs still create via `importExistingAppSecret=false`.  
3. Tag update caused non-replacement `UPDATE_COMPLETE` events on tagged resources (buckets/Aurora writer metadata); secret value untouched.

---

## 23. Open risks

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Future accidental create path | Low | Protection tests + flag default false |

---

## 24. Human sign-off section

| Role | Name | Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure / Product | Jeremy Powell | 2026-07-27 | APPROVED deploy | Founder, Forge Public Safety |
| Engineering closeout | Agent-assisted | 2026-07-27 | RECONCILED | Evidence captured |

---

## 25. Phase 4 readiness recommendation

GAP-009 no longer blocks Data-stack updates for development. **Do not begin NERIS Phase 4** unless separately authorized. Phase 3 remains ACCEPTED.
