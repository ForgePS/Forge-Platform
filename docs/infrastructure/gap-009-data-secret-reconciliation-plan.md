**Status:** APPROVAL_READY (not deployed)  
**Date:** 2026-07-27  
**Account:** 511343547817  
**Region:** us-east-1  
**Protected secret:** `forge-development-secrets-database-app`  
**Runtime role:** `forge_app`  
**Phase 4:** Not started

## 1. Current state

### Secrets Manager (application)

| Field | Value (sanitized) |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `forge-development-secrets-database-app` |
| ARN | `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:511343547817:secret:forge-development-secrets-database-app-SknUu5` |
| Description | Aurora forge_app runtime credentials for API and worker |
| CreatedDate | 2026-07-26T15:30:16-05:00 |
| LastChangedDate | 2026-07-26T15:30:16-05:00 |
| KMS | Default AWS-managed (KmsKeyId null) |
| Resource policy | None |
| Rotation | Disabled / none |
| Tags | None |
| Replication | None |
| DeletedDate | null (not scheduled for deletion) |
| CloudFormation ownership | **None** — not present in `Forge-Development-Data` stack resources |

### Secrets Manager (admin / migration)

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `forge-development-secrets-database` |
| ARN suffix | `…database-b2BejX` |
| CFN logical ID | `DatabaseDbSecret1098DC6E` |
| Ownership | **Owned by** `Forge-Development-Data` |

### ECS references

| Service | Cluster | Task definition | Env | Value (prefix) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `forge-development-ecs-platform-api` | `forge-development-ecs-platform` | `:16` (1/1 HEALTHY) | `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN` | `…:secret:forge-development-secrets-database-app` |
| `forge-development-ecs-worker-service` | same | revision 14 | `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN` | same name prefix |

Compute resolves the app secret via `Secret.fromSecretNameV2` in `ComputeStack` (GAP-009 workaround). Runtime username expected: `forge_app`.

### Aurora

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Cluster | `forge-development-rds-aurora` (available) |
| Database | `forge_platform` |
| Master username | `forge_admin` |
| App role | `forge_app` (FORCE RLS subject) |
| Admin secret | `forge-development-secrets-database` (CFN-managed) |
| App secret | `forge-development-secrets-database-app` (external) |
| SG | `sg-0f117aede3d003d00` |
| Restore | PITR available; recent AWS Backup + automated snapshots present |
| Earliest / latest restorable | ~2026-07-25 → 2026-07-27 (sampled) |

### Data stack CDK / CFN

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Stack name | `Forge-Development-Data` (construct id `ForgeData`) |
| Status | `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` (failed prior update rolled back) |
| Construct path | `ForgeData` → `Database` (`ForgeDatabase`) → `AppDbSecret` |
| Prior behavior | `new secretsmanager.Secret(..., secretName: forge-*-secrets-database-app)` |
| Failure mode | `AlreadyExists` on create → rollback |
| Compute dependency | Compute depends on Data; normal Compute deploy without `--exclusively` re-enters Data |

### Pre-deploy health (2026-07-27 ~06:10–11:12 CDT)

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| STS account | 511343547817 |
| API health | 200 |
| RMS | 200 |
| API task `:16` | HEALTHY 1/1 |
| CloudTrail logging | true (LatestDeliveryTime 2026-07-27T06:10:56-05:00) |
| api-5xx / api-cf-5xx / running-tasks | OK |
| App secret LastChangedDate | unchanged |

---

## 2. Root cause

The application secret was created **outside** CloudFormation ownership (Phase 2 `forge_app` provisioning) with the same physical name that `ForgeDatabase` later tried to **create** on Data stack update. CloudFormation cannot create a secret that already exists → `AlreadyExists` → `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE`. Compute was patched to import by name and deploy with `--exclusively`, leaving Data unable to update safely.

---

## 3. Selected strategy

### Strategy A — Import by name (`Secret.fromSecretNameV2`) — **SELECTED**

When `config.database.importExistingAppSecret === true` (development):

```typescript
this.appSecret = secretsmanager.Secret.fromSecretNameV2(
  this,
  "AppDbSecret",
  resourceName(config, "secrets", "database-app"),
);
```

Effects:

- No `AWS::SecretsManager::Secret` for `database-app` in the Data template
- No create / replace / delete of the protected secret
- ARN and value unchanged
- ECS continues using the same name/ARN prefix
- Greenfield environments keep `importExistingAppSecret: false` (create path retained)

**Evidence:** In-process synth shows `contains-database-app=false`, `contains-AppDbSecret=false`. Live `cdk diff ForgeData` → **0 differences** (template now matches deployed reality: only admin secret managed).

---

## 4. Rejected strategies

| Strategy | Decision | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| B — CFN resource import | Rejected for now | App secret never existed as a stack resource; import would adopt lifecycle (risk of future delete/replace). Not needed for reference-only use. |
| C — Foundational secrets stack | Rejected for now | Extra stack churn without reducing risk vs name import; can revisit later. |
| D — Parameterized external only | Partial overlap | Config flag documents ownership; Strategy A implements the reference. Pure Parameter Store ARN would still need IAM wiring. |

---

## 5. CDK changes (implemented; not deployed)

| File | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/config/environment-schema.ts` | `database.importExistingAppSecret` (default false) |
| `lib/config/development.ts` | `importExistingAppSecret: true` |
| `lib/constructs/forge-database.ts` | Import-by-name vs create branch; ownership docs |
| `bin/forge-platform.ts` | Comment: do not pass created AppDbSecret export |
| `test/gap-009-app-secret-protection.test.ts` | Protection tests |
| `test/data-stack.test.ts` | Assert no protected secret create |
| `test/compute-stack.test.ts` | Missing Cognito/origin props restored (suite load) |

---

## 6. CloudFormation implications

- **Deployed Data stack today:** Already has no AppDbSecret resource (create never succeeded).
- **After code change synth:** Still no AppDbSecret resource → **empty Data diff**.
- **Deploy of Data (when approved):** Expected to be a no-op or only unrelated pending changes; must re-run `cdk diff ForgeData` immediately before deploy and abort if any secret create/replace/delete appears.
- **Do not** flip `importExistingAppSecret` from `false`→`true` on a stack that already owns AppDbSecret without an approved import/orphan plan (would delete the CFN resource).

---

## 7. Secret ownership (target)

| Secret | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forge-*-secrets-database` | Data CDK / CFN | Admin / migrate |
| `forge-*-secrets-database-app` | **External / operational** (referenced by CDK) | Runtime `forge_app`; not CFN-lifecycle-managed in development |

---

## 8. ECS dependencies

No ECS task definition change required. Keep `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN` pointing at `forge-*-secrets-database-app`. Do not regenerate password. Do not change task revision solely for this reconciliation.

---

## 9. Aurora dependencies

No Aurora cluster or password change. Admin secret remains CFN-managed. App role `forge_app` unchanged. Recovery points available before any Data deploy.

---

## 10. Deployment commands (after approval only)

```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=forge-dev
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=511343547817
export CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

cd infrastructure/cdk
pnpm test
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm nag
pnpm exec cdk diff ForgeData
# STOP if diff shows Secrets Manager create/replace/delete for database-app

pnpm exec cdk deploy ForgeData --exclusively --require-approval broadening
# Monitor CFN events; abort on secret replacement

pnpm exec cdk diff ForgeData   # expect stable / empty for secret section
```

Do **not** deploy unrelated stacks in the same command. Do **not** deploy Data until this plan is approved.

---

## 11. Pre-deployment checks

- [ ] Account 511343547817 / region us-east-1
- [ ] SSO active (`aws sts get-caller-identity`)
- [ ] API `:16` healthy; API/RMS 200
- [ ] CloudTrail logging; review alarms
- [ ] Record app secret ARN + LastChangedDate
- [ ] Record ECS `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN`
- [ ] Confirm Aurora restore window / snapshot
- [ ] `cdk diff ForgeData` non-destructive for secrets
- [ ] Human approval recorded

---

## 12. Rollback plan

1. **If Data deploy fails mid-update:** Allow CloudFormation rollback (stack previously recovered from `UPDATE_ROLLBACK_COMPLETE` pattern).
2. **If secret were ever targeted (must not happen):** Stop immediately; do not delete/rotate; restore connectivity by confirming ECS still references existing ARN; engage break-glass only with separate authorization.
3. **Code rollback:** Revert CDK commit; Compute exclusive deploy path remains available.
4. **Aurora:** Restore from PITR / AWS Backup only if database corruption (not expected for secret-reference-only change).

Expected downtime for empty/no-op Data deploy: **none**.

---

## 13. Post-deployment verification

- Secret ARN unchanged; LastChangedDate unchanged
- No rotation events
- ECS env still `…database-app`; API HEALTHY; health 200
- `forge_app` runtime; FORCE RLS; tenant-isolation + Phase 3 smoke
- `cdk diff ForgeData` no longer proposes AppDbSecret create
- CloudWatch / CloudTrail OK

---

## 14. Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accidental future create path in shared envs | Medium | Flag default false; protection tests; review diffs |
| Flipping import→create ownership wrongly | High | Documented ban; approval gate |
| Unrelated Data drift on first successful update after rollback | Medium | Exclusive Data deploy; inspect full diff |
| SSO directory alarm noise | Low | Known from operator login |

---

## 15. Cost impact

Negligible — no new resources; reference-only change.

---

## 16. Human approval gate

**Do not deploy `Forge-Development-Data` until explicitly approved.**
