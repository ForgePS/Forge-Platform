# MK-S23 Complete — Production Readiness

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S23  
**Completed:** 2026-08-11  
**Sprint status:** PASS WITH CONDITIONS  
**Readiness verdict:** NOT READY  
**MK-S22 E2E condition:** OUTSTANDING  
**Repair passes used:** 0

## Objective achieved

Expanded production-readiness and deployment-planning documentation per full directive. Deliverable: `MK-S23-production-readiness.md`. No production deploy, migrate, or AWS mutation.

## Scope completed

- Environment inventory + ownership  
- Secrets / Cognito / DB / billing / SES review (no secret values)  
- IAM least-privilege notes  
- Database production migration plan (not executed)  
- MK-S22 E2E condition carried forward as OUTSTANDING  
- CloudFront / S3 / Cognito / network / DNS / ACM / WAF reviews  
- Observability + launch alarm list  
- Backup / DR / deploy sequence / rollback / smoke / post-deploy UAT  
- Firebase customer-data migration dependency (not executed)  
- Verdict: **NOT READY**

## Conditions

1. MK-S22 full HTTP E2E not yet executed against isolated test DB (blocks unconditional READY).  
2. CRITICAL launch blockers remain (SES, prod config, APP_ENV, prod deploy guard, etc.).

## Out of scope honored

- No production ops  
- No BACKLOG feature work  
- No Firebase cutover execution  
- No MK-S24

## Next sprint

NOT AUTHORIZED.
