# MK-S14 Complete — Storage / Branding

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S14  
**Completed:** 2026-08-10  
**Verdict:** PASS  
**Repair passes used:** 0

## Objective achieved

Tenant branding fields expanded; logo/icon assignments require tenant-owned `forge_documents`; branding assets use tenant-prefixed keys with timed signed upload/download. No production ops.

## Scope completed

- `tenant_branding` columns + migration `0033_mk_s14_branding_storage.sql` (not applied prod)
- Ownership guards + PUT rejection for cross-tenant document IDs
- Upload/download: `.../branding/assets/upload-url` and `.../assets/:id/download-url`
- Permissions: platform or tenant configuration.update
- Studio config schema fields aligned for name/footer/report/colors
- Creator + Tenant Admin branding forms
- Docs: `STORAGE_BRANDING.md`

## Out of scope honored

- Production deploy / bucket CDK changes
- Full Studio redesign / dual-store merge
- MK-S15 API keys
