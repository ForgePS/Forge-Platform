# MK-S11 Complete — Creator Console Control Plane

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S11  
**Completed:** 2026-08-10  
**Verdict:** PASS  
**Repair passes used:** 0

## Objective achieved

Creator Console is oriented as the Forge SaaS control plane: required primary navigation, plan catalog API, Modules/Plans/Contracts/System pages, tenant-detail section panels, and client page gates. API `RequirePermission` remains authoritative.

## Scope completed

- Nav reorg in `CREATOR_NAV_GROUPS` with `permission` / `anyOfPermissions` (UX filter only)
- `GET /api/v1/platform/plans` via `ProductsService.listPlans`
- Pages: `/modules`, `/plans`, `/contracts`, `/system`
- `PlatformPageGate` on Overview, Tenants, Users, Products, Modules, Plans, Contracts, Billing, Feature Flags, Audit, System, Entitlements, Tenant detail
- Tenant detail sections: Summary, Status, Contacts, Facilities, Members, Products, Modules, Subscription, Contract, Branding, Feature Flags, Usage, Activity, Audit

## Out of scope honored

- Full visual redesign / Makerkit clone
- MK-S12 Tenant Admin Console
- Production operations / migrations applied to prod
- Studio / NERIS / AI rewrite (secondary nav)
