# MK-S17 Complete — Performance / Navigation

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S17  
**Completed:** 2026-08-10  
**Verdict:** PASS  
**Repair passes used:** 0

## Objective achieved

Hardened Creator Console and Tenant Admin against stale tenant paint races, duplicate notification fetches, and unbounded list rendering without changing the Next/React stack or introducing shared authz caches.

## Scope completed

- `resolveActiveTenantId` / `syncTenantIdInUrl` + web-kit helpers / AbortSignal on api client
- Notification menus: clear on switch; unread-count only until open
- Audit: truthful `total` + page controls (CC + TA)
- Members: client pagination + generation guards
- Memoized nav filter; dynamic Config Studio loading
- Docs: `PERFORMANCE_NAVIGATION.md`

## Out of scope honored

- No framework change / React Query
- No MK-S18 search
- No industrial redesign
- No production deploy
