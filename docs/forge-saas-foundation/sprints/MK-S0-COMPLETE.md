# MK-S0 Complete — Baseline / Discovery

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S0  
**Completed:** 2026-08-10  
**Verdict:** PASS  
**Repair passes used:** 0

## Objective achieved

Forge SaaS capabilities, architecture, and verification baseline are documented so later sprints can REUSE existing systems instead of rebuilding them. No product/feature implementation was performed. No production operations.

## Key findings

1. **SaaS core already exists** under NestJS `platform-api` + Drizzle/Postgres RLS + Cognito: tenants, memberships, RBAC, invitations, products/modules/entitlements, feature flags, subscription lifecycle (`billingProvider=NONE`), onboarding, audit, branding, Creator Console, Tenant Admin.
2. **Canonical packages:** `@forge/tenant-context`, `@forge/authorization`, `@forge/auth`, `@forge/database`, `@forge/web-kit`.
3. **Primary gaps for later sprints:** Stripe/PSP, SES/notifications engine, tenant API keys, generic outbound webhooks, portal apps, unified facilities model, industrial Cognito client export consistency, Creator→web-kit consolidation.
4. **Framework lock:** Keep Next.js + NestJS + Cognito + Aurora; Industrial Sneat; do not migrate to Makerkit stacks.
5. **Unrelated WIP preserved:** industrial-web / analytics working-tree changes were not touched or committed.

## Baseline verification (2026-08-10)

| Check | Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Typecheck | `pnpm typecheck` | **FAIL (historical)** | `@forge/rms-web-e2e` — `document` missing from TS lib (`phase-3-*.spec.ts`). Unrelated to MK-S0 docs. |
| Lint | `pnpm lint` | **FAIL (historical)** | `@forge/imports` — unused `fileName` in `src/formats/detect.ts`. Unrelated to MK-S0 docs. |
| Unit | `pnpm test:unit` | **FAIL (historical)** | Fail-fast on `@forge/creator-console` — cannot resolve `@forge/web-kit` in `api-url.test.ts`. Also observed `@forge/infrastructure-cdk` cost-profile assertion failure mid-run. Many packages passed beforehand (incl. `@forge/authorization` 7/7, `@forge/tenant-context` 1/1, `@forge/audit` 2/2, `@forge/web-kit` 13/13). |
| Core SaaS build | filtered build of tenant-context, authorization, auth, audit, contracts, web-kit, database | **PASS** | Full monorepo `pnpm build` not required for S0 once core build verified; historical failures would dominate anyway. |
| Infra validate | `pnpm infra:validate` | **PASS** | Development config validation `ok: true`. |
| Production check | N/A | **NOT RUN** | No root `production-check` script; production ops prohibited. |
| Integration / E2E / Auth suite | Full suites | **NOT RUN** | Heavy env dependency; S0 records existing unit authZ coverage instead. |

MK-S0 intentionally **did not repair** historical failures (directive §27 / §52).

Approximate unit tests observed passing before fail-fast (non-exhaustive sum from package summaries): **~165+ passed**, **≥2 failed** (creator-console + infrastructure-cdk cost-profile), package task fail reported as creator-console.

## Security

- Documentation only.
- No Secrets Manager reads.
- No production Cognito/IAM/DNS/S3/Stripe changes.
- No deployments.

## Database

None.

## Deferred

See `BACKLOG.md` items BACKLOG-001 through BACKLOG-010.

## Next sprint

**NOT AUTHORIZED.** MK-S1 must not start until explicit authorization updates `PROGRAM_STATE.json`.
