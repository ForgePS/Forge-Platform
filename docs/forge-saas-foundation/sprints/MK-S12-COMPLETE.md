# MK-S12 Complete — Tenant Administration

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S12  
**Completed:** 2026-08-10  
**Verdict:** PASS  
**Repair passes used:** 0

## Objective achieved

Tenant Admin is the customer-facing admin surface with the required sections, permissioned navigation, and page gates. Configuration Studio remains secondary (not redesigned). API authorization remains authoritative.

## Scope completed

- `TENANT_ADMIN_NAV_GROUPS` reorganized with permission metadata
- `TenantPageGate` on primary pages
- Section pages: Overview, Organization, Facilities, Members, Invitations, Roles, Permissions, Products, Modules, Billing, Branding, Security, Notifications, Integrations, API (`/api-access`), Audit
- Membership/invitation helpers in Tenant Admin `api.ts`
- Notifications / Integrations / API as gated foundations (full productization in MK-S13/S15)

## Out of scope honored

- Studio redesign
- MK-S13+ product features beyond stubs
- Production ops
- Creator Console changes
