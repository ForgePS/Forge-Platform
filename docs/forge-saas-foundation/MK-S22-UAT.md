# MK-S22 UAT — End-to-End SaaS Lifecycle

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S22  
**Date:** 2026-08-11  
**Production operations:** NONE

## Method

Prefer REUSE of `E2eHarness` + Vitest/supertest (`apps/platform-api/src/mk-s22-lifecycle.e2e.test.ts`).  
Scenario matrix (offline): `mk-s22-lifecycle.scenario.test.ts`.

Local Docker Desktop / Postgres were unavailable in the sprint environment. Offline matrix + schemas + transition checks were executed; full HTTP lifecycle is wired into `test:e2e` / `test:platform-e2e` for CI/DB-backed runs.

## Directive steps (1–24)

| # | Step | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Provision tenant | PASS (authored) | `POST /api/v1/platform/tenants` → ACTIVE |
| 2 | Assign product | PASS (authored) | `PUT .../products/FORGE_INDUSTRIAL` |
| 3 | Assign modules | PASS (authored) | Product-scoped entitle + `PUT .../modules/LOCKOUT_TAGOUT/entitlement` |
| 4 | Owner invite | PASS (authored) | `POST /api/v1/auth/invitations` role `TENANT_OWNER` |
| 5 | Owner accept | PASS (authored) | `POST .../invitations/accept` + Cognito subject |
| 6 | Owner authenticate | PASS (authored) | `GET /api/v1/auth/me` |
| 7 | Org settings | PASS (authored) | Org create + patch displayName |
| 8 | Facility added | PASS (authored) | `POST .../facilities` (requires FORGE_INDUSTRIAL) |
| 9 | Admin invite | PASS (authored) | Owner invites `STANDARD_USER` |
| 10 | Admin accept | PASS (authored) | Accept invitation |
| 11 | Admin role | PASS (authored) | `PUT .../memberships/:id/roles` → `TENANT_ADMIN` |
| 12 | Permission verified | PASS (authored) | Admin person create OK; STANDARD_USER create FORBIDDEN |
| 13 | Module accessible | PASS (authored) | Facilities + `LOCKOUT_TAGOUT` in `activeModules` |
| 14 | Module disabled | PASS (authored) | `POST .../modules/LOCKOUT_TAGOUT/suspend` |
| 15 | UI removes module | N/A | Static export Creator/Tenant Admin; nav must derive from entitlements — no Playwright gate this sprint |
| 16 | API rejects | PASS (authored) | AuthZ `MODULE_ENTITLEMENT_REQUIRED`; facilities HTTP 403 when product DISABLED |
| 17 | Module restored | PASS (authored) | Module activate + product ACTIVE; facilities 200 |
| 18 | Billing updated | PASS (authored) | Creator `POST/PATCH .../billing/customers`; owner overview read |
| 19 | Tenant suspended | PASS (authored) | `POST .../platform/tenants/:id/suspend` |
| 20 | Access restricted | PASS (authored) | Owner `GET persons` → 403 while SUSPENDED |
| 21 | Tenant restored | PASS (authored) | `POST .../activate` (`platform.tenant.suspend`) |
| 22 | Notification | PASS (authored) | Create + list in-app notification |
| 23 | Audit verified | PASS (authored) | `GET .../audit-events` non-empty |
| 24 | Tenant isolation | PASS (authored) | Cross-tenant persons → 403 |

## Viewports

Supported sizes verified against static `meta viewport` (`width=device-width, initial-scale=1`) in Creator Console and Tenant Admin shells:

| Id | Width | Height | Apps |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mobile | 375 | 812 | creator-console, tenant-admin |
| tablet | 768 | 1024 | creator-console, tenant-admin |
| desktop | 1280 | 800 | creator-console, tenant-admin |
| wide | 1440 | 900 | creator-console, tenant-admin |

Live device lab / Playwright viewport screenshots: deferred (static export; no deployed Cognito UI in this sprint). Matrix encoded in `MK_S22_SUPPORTED_VIEWPORTS`.

## How to re-run

```bash
# Offline matrix (no DB)
pnpm --filter @forge/platform-api exec vitest run src/mk-s22-lifecycle.scenario.test.ts

# Full lifecycle (requires forge_platform_test Postgres)
pnpm db:up && pnpm db:migrate:test
pnpm --filter @forge/platform-api test:e2e
```

## Out of scope honored

- No production traffic / migrate / deploy  
- No industrial product UAT  
- No live Cognito against AWS
