# Memberships & Tenant Context (MK-S3)

## Authoritative model

**Canonical table:** `user_tenant_memberships` (ADR-021)  
Compatibility projection `user_tenant_access` remains dual-written — do not invent a third model.

| Field | Column |
| --- | --- |
| membershipId | `id` |
| userId | `user_id` |
| tenantId | `tenant_id` |
| status | `status` |
| createdAt | `created_at` |
| updatedAt | `updated_at` |
| joinedAt | `activated_at` (when ACTIVE) |
| deactivatedAt | `suspended_at` / `revoked_at` |

## Status mapping (SaaS vocabulary → Forge)

| SaaS | Forge (stored) | Tenant selectable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| pending | `PENDING` | No |
| active | `ACTIVE` | Yes (if tenant session-eligible) |
| inactive | `SUSPENDED` | No |
| removed | `REVOKED` | No |

Also present: `EXPIRED`, `ARCHIVED` (ADR-021 terminals).

Helpers: `@forge/contracts` `resolveMembershipStatusAlias`, `isMembershipStatusActive`.

## Tenant switching

1. Client calls `POST /api/v1/auth/select-tenant` with `{ tenantId }`.
2. Server requires ACTIVE membership (or platform admin) + tenant session eligibility (MK-S2).
3. Response is a full AuthMe summary for the new tenant.
4. `@forge/web-kit` `switchActiveTenant` replaces client `me` and rolls back persisted tenant id on failure.

Client-provided `x-tenant-id` is never trusted without the same membership gate in `resolvePrincipal`.
