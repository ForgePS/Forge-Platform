# PROD-S0R — ACM / HTTPS inventory

**Account:** `511343547817` · **Region for CloudFront certs:** `us-east-1`  
**Customer DNS / app routing changes:** NOT AUTHORIZED in PROD-S0R  
**edge.enableHttps:** remains `false` until ISSUED cert is wired to the Production edge and cutover is authorized

## Required production hostnames

| Role | Hostname | Covered by existing cert SANs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apex | `forgepublicsafety.com` | YES |
| API | `api.forgepublicsafety.com` | YES (`*.forgepublicsafety.com`) |
| Creator | `creator.forgepublicsafety.com` | YES |
| Tenant Admin | `admin.forgepublicsafety.com` | YES |
| Industrial | `industrial.forgepublicsafety.com` | YES |
| RMS | `rms.forgepublicsafety.com` | YES |
| Academy | `academy.forgepublicsafety.com` | YES |
| SES mail domain | `mail.forgepublicsafety.com` | YES (TLS identity; SES DKIM separate) |

## Existing certificate (do not recreate)

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| ARN | `arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:511343547817:certificate/ca267baa-304e-4ffd-be51-7350abab0c3f` |
| Status | **ISSUED** |
| Domain | `forgepublicsafety.com` |
| SANs | `forgepublicsafety.com`, `*.forgepublicsafety.com` |
| Region | `us-east-1` (CloudFront-compatible) |
| Validation | DNS — SUCCESS |

### Validation CNAMEs (already satisfied; recorded for evidence)

| Name | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_c9ee6545e9c5aaab68c80d5f1eeca052.forgepublicsafety.com.` | CNAME | `_d78866a343b58532dc66b7abb5140693.jkddzztszm.acm-validations.aws.` |

Same record validates both apex and wildcard.

## Current associations

Certificate is **in use by Development** CloudFront distributions (`*-dev.forgepublicsafety.com` and coexistence host). That is ownership/validation proof — **not** production customer cutover.

## Route53 in account

No `forgepublicsafety.com` public hosted zone was found in account `511343547817` via `list-hosted-zones`. DNS for the domain appears to live outside this account (or in another account). **Do not invent external DNS changes.**

## Production wiring status

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Cert ISSUED with required SAN coverage | PASS |
| `production.ts` records `certificateArn` | PASS |
| ALB HTTPS (`edge.enableHttps`) | OFF (intentional) |
| Production CloudFront aliases | Not deployed |
| Application A/AAAA/CNAME cutover | NOT DONE / NOT AUTHORIZED |

## Classification

**ACM_HTTPS = READY WITH CONDITIONS**

Conditions:

1. Production edge must attach the ISSUED cert only after Compute/Frontend are authorized (PROD-S1+).
2. Application DNS routing records must remain untouched until cutover sprint.
3. Hosted-zone ownership / record installation for any *future* ACM requests must be coordinated with external DNS operators if not using in-account Route53.
