# MK-S23 Production Readiness — FORGE-SAAS-CORE

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S23  
**Date:** 2026-08-11  
**Production operations:** NONE  
**Production migrations:** NONE  
**Production AWS modifications:** NONE  
**Deferred BACKLOG work:** NONE  

---

## Overall readiness verdict

```text
NOT READY
```

Unconditional **READY** is forbidden while the **MK-S22 full HTTP E2E condition remains OUTSTANDING**, and while CRITICAL production blockers below remain open.

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Sprint delivery status | PASS WITH CONDITIONS |
| Readiness verdict | NOT READY |
| MK-S22 E2E condition | OUTSTANDING |
| Production authorized | NO |

---

## Outstanding condition from MK-S22 (mandatory carry-forward)

**MK-S22:** PASS WITH CONDITIONS — **not** a clean PASS.

**Condition:** Local Postgres/Docker was unavailable; the full HTTP lifecycle suite was authored and CI-wired but **not** executed against `forge_platform_test`.

**Required validation (isolated test DB only — never production):**

```bash
pnpm db:up
pnpm db:migrate:test
pnpm --filter @forge/platform-api test:e2e
```

**Evidence paths:** `apps/platform-api/src/mk-s22-lifecycle.e2e.test.ts`, `docs/forge-saas-foundation/MK-S22-UAT.md`.

**Rule:** Production readiness must not be scored READY or READY WITH CONDITIONS as an *unconditional* go-live until this E2E either:

- **A.** passes locally against the isolated test database, **or**  
- **B.** passes in CI against an isolated test database with retained evidence.

This document records the condition as **OUTSTANDING**.

## 1. Environment inventory

### 1.1 Required variables (`packages/environment`)

| Group | Keys (names only) | Ownership |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | `NODE_ENV`, `APP_ENV`, `APP_NAME`, `APP_VERSION`, `LOG_LEVEL`, `AWS_PARTITION`, `AWS_REGION`, `AWS_SECONDARY_REGION`, `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID` | Platform eng / deploy |
| Database | `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_HOST`, `DATABASE_PORT`, `DATABASE_NAME`, `DATABASE_USERNAME`, `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN` | DBA / CDK Data stack |
| Cognito | `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`, `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`, `COGNITO_DOMAIN` | Identity stack |
| KMS | `KMS_GENERAL_KEY_ARN`, `KMS_SENSITIVE_DATA_KEY_ARN` | Security stack |
| S3 | `S3_DOCUMENT_BUCKET`, `S3_IMPORT_BUCKET`, `S3_EXPORT_BUCKET`, `S3_AUDIT_BUCKET` | Data / frontend stacks |
| Queues | `SQS_IMPORT_QUEUE_URL`, `SQS_NOTIFICATION_QUEUE_URL` (+ optional CAD) | Messaging stack |
| Public URLs | `PUBLIC_ACADEMY_URL`, `PUBLIC_RMS_URL`, `PUBLIC_CREATOR_URL`, `PUBLIC_API_URL` | Edge / DNS owners |
| SES | `SES_FROM_ADDRESS` | Messaging / ops |
| Flags | `FEATURE_FLAG_PROVIDER`; optional `CORS_ORIGINS`, `BODY_SIZE_LIMIT`, `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | App config |

**App-only (not in `@forge/environment` schema):** `BILLING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (billing controller header verification).

### 1.2 Development / staging / production differences

| Concern | Local / development / testing | Staging / production-like |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Public URLs | `http` allowed | **HTTPS required** |
| `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN` | Optional (placeholder) | **Required ARN** |
| KMS ARNs | Min-length strings | Valid ARNs |
| CDK account | Real/dev account configs | `production.ts` still placeholder `000000000000` |
| Cognito callbacks | localhost + `*-dev.forgepublicsafety.com` | Still `academy.example.com` in `production.ts` |
| ECS `APP_ENV` | Hardcoded `"development"` in `forge-ecs.ts` today | **Must** become environment-driven before launch |
| Deploy CI | `.github/workflows/deploy-development.yml` only | **No** production workflow |

### 1.3 Missing / incomplete configuration before launch

- Real production AWS account + region mapping  
- Production Cognito callback/logout URLs  
- Production public HTTPS domain set for academy/RMS/creator/tenant-admin/API  
- Live SES identity + provider wiring  
- `BILLING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (and provider) if billing webhooks go live  
- SNS alarm subscribers  
- Production OIDC deploy role + approval gate  

### 1.4 Secrets that must exist before launch (names / purpose — no values)

| Secret / config | Purpose | Must exist before |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forge-{env}-secrets-database` | Aurora migrate/admin | Migrate tasks |
| `forge-{env}-secrets-database-app` | App RLS role credentials | API/worker boot |
| Cognito pool/client/domain IDs in task env | Auth | API boot |
| KMS key ARNs | Field encryption / buckets | API + S3 |
| `forge-{env}-cad-*` (optional) | CAD webhooks | CAD features |
| SES verified identity (not yet CDK) | Outbound mail | Invite/notification go-live |
| `BILLING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Provider webhook auth | Billing ingestion |

### 1.5 Configuration ownership

| Owner | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| Platform engineering | Nest env schema, ECS task env, app code |
| Infrastructure (CDK) | Secrets naming, IAM, Cognito, Aurora, buckets, CF, WAF, alarms |
| Ops / security | Alarm paging, production deploy approval, ACM/DNS cutover |
| Product programs | Firebase cutover (separate authorization) |

---

## 2. AWS Secrets / configuration

| System | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Secrets Manager — DB master | READY (pattern) | CDK `rds.DatabaseSecret` |
| Secrets Manager — DB app | CONDITION | GAP-009 import vs create; required at launch |
| SSM Parameter Store | N/A | No CDK SSM parameters found |
| Cognito configuration | CONDITION | Pool ready; prod URLs placeholder |
| Database credentials | CONDITION | Dual-secret model documented; values never in docs |
| API secrets (KMS, buckets, queues) | CONDITION | Injected via ECS task env from stack outputs |
| Billing / webhook secrets | GAP | Ad-hoc env; provider often `NONE` |
| SES configuration | GAP | Noop/stub provider; no SES CDK identity |
| Third-party / CAD secrets | CONDITION | Naming convention `forge-{env}-cad-*`; optional |

**Do not paste secret values into git, tickets, or this document.**

---

## 3. IAM review

| Check | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| Application task roles | Separate API / worker / migrate roles (`forge-ecs.ts`) |
| Secrets access | App + **master** secret `grantRead` on API/worker — **least-privilege CONDITION** |
| S3 access | Task `grantReadWrite` documents/imports/exports — broad for prod review |
| Database access | Via secrets + security groups (private Aurora); migrate uses admin secret only |
| CloudWatch | Execution role logging via managed ECS execution policy |
| Deployment roles | Dev GitHub OIDC only; **prod deploy role GAP** |
| Lambda/service roles | Primary compute is **ECS Fargate**, not Lambda API |
| Cross-tenant risks | App uses FORCE RLS + AuthZ; IAM itself is account-wide (expected) |
| Wildcards | S3 deny-insecure uses `s3:*` conditioned on `aws:SecureTransport=false`; CAD secret ARN pattern wildcard |

**Launch prerequisite:** Documented least-privilege pass (drop unnecessary master-secret read from runtime API; tighten S3 prefixes if feasible).

---

## 4. Database production migration plan

**DO NOT run production migrations in this sprint.**

### 4.1 Order (logical)

1. Confirm Aurora up, deletion protection on, backup retention ≥ production profile (35d).  
2. Take / confirm fresh backup / PITR window.  
3. Apply Drizzle migrations via **ECS one-off migrate task** using **admin** secret only (`scripts/run-ecs-migrate.mjs`).  
4. Run migrate status / RLS verification scripts against non-prod first; then production under change control.  
5. Smoke API health before cutover traffic.

### 4.2 Prerequisites

- Image built/pushed  
- Admin secret present  
- Network path migrate task → Aurora  
- Change ticket + production authorization (separate from MK-S23)

### 4.3 Downtime

- Prefer online forward migrations; expect brief connection blips during DDL  
- Planned maintenance window if heavy locks anticipated (assess per migration set)

### 4.4 Backup requirements

- Pre-migrate snapshot / rely on Aurora automated backups + AWS Backup plan  
- Record restore point ID before apply

### 4.5 Rollback strategy

- **Forward-only** schema policy (`docs/operations/database-migration-runbook.md`)  
- Rollback = restore snapshot / PITR to pre-migrate point + redeploy prior API image  
- Never “down migrate” in production

### 4.6 Verification

- Migration status complete  
- RLS forced on tenant tables  
- Health + auth smoke  
- Spot-check invite / tenant isolation (non-destructive)

### 4.7 Schema compatibility / failure handling

- App version must be compatible with applied schema (deploy API after migrate when additive; coordinate breaking changes with dual-write/dual-read plan)  
- On migrate failure: stop deploy, do not proceed to frontends; restore if DB left inconsistent

---

## 5. CloudFront review

| Topic | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| Distributions | Static SPA hosts (console/RMS/tenant-admin) + API distribution |
| Origins | Private S3 + OAC (static); ALB HTTP_ONLY (API) until ACM cutover |
| Caching | Static: managed CachingOptimized (ops docs); API: **CACHING_DISABLED** |
| SPA / static export | CF Function + 403/404 → `/index.html` (5m error TTL) |
| API separation | Separate API CF distribution; no caching of authenticated responses |
| Auth-sensitive caching | API cache disabled — appropriate |
| Security headers | Static + API response headers policies (HSTS, frame deny, CSP variants) |
| Invalidation | Required after `scripts/sync-static-site.mjs` sync |
| Deploy ordering | Sync S3 **then** invalidate; DNS/alias after cert ready |

**No production CloudFront changes in MK-S23.**

---

## 6. S3 review

| Control | Status (`forge-buckets.ts` + static hosts) |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend buckets | Private + OAC only |
| Tenant file storage | documents / imports / exports / audit archive |
| Bucket policies | Enforce SSL; public blocked |
| Public access blocks | `BLOCK_ALL` |
| Encryption | KMS on data buckets; S3-managed on static origins |
| CORS | Not configured on data buckets (prefer CF/API paths) |
| Lifecycle | Import/export retention from cost profile; audit retain |
| Versioning | On for data buckets; off for applicationAssets |
| Tenant isolation | Application-layer + object key prefixes; FORCE RLS for DB metadata |
| Presigned URLs | App-issued; short TTL patterns in branding/docs domains |

---

## 7. Cognito review

| Topic | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| User pool | Email alias; auto-verify email |
| App clients | Academy, RMS, Creator, Department, Student — public clients, SRP, no password auth flow |
| Callback / logout | Config-driven; **production still example.com** |
| Token lifetime | Not overridden in CDK (service defaults) — set explicitly before launch |
| MFA | OPTIONAL |
| Groups / claims | Custom claims via app token enrichment — verify launch claims map |
| Account recovery | EMAIL_ONLY |
| Self signup | Disabled in production config |
| Firebase Auth migration | **Separate program** — not in MK-S23 |

**Do not modify production Cognito in this sprint.**

---

## 8. Network / API review

| Layer | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| API surface | ECS Fargate behind ALB (+ API CloudFront) — not API Gateway for core platform |
| VPC | Private Aurora; public ALB pattern in CDK |
| Security groups | Task ↔ DB restricted |
| CORS | Env `CORS_ORIGINS` + API CF allowlist from browser origins |
| Throttling | WAF rate limits not custom-documented beyond AWS Managed CRS; launch needs rate rule plan |
| Public/private | DB private; static via CF; ALB currently HTTP origin to CF |

---

## 9. Domain / DNS review

### Documented / configured hostnames (non-secret)

| Environment | Examples found in-repo |
| --- | --- |
| Development | `api-dev.forgepublicsafety.com`, `console-dev.forgepublicsafety.com`, `rms-dev.forgepublicsafety.com`, `creator-dev.forgepublicsafety.com`, `admin-dev.forgepublicsafety.com`, `industrial-dev.forgepublicsafety.com` |
| Production commercial | **Not finalized** in `production.ts` (placeholders) |
| Legacy Firebase | `forge-academy-95f84.web.app`, `rms.forgepublicsafety.com` |

### Targets for production planning (to be filled before launch)

| Role | Production target (TBD) | ACM / CF notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creator Console | TBD | CF cert in **us-east-1** |
| Tenant Admin | TBD | CF us-east-1 |
| RMS web | TBD | CF us-east-1 |
| Academy web | TBD | CF us-east-1 |
| Platform API | TBD | CF and/or ALB ACM (regional) |

**Do not change DNS in MK-S23.** Document Route53 vs external DNS ownership before cutover. Redirect strategy (Firebase → AWS) belongs to migration program.

---

## 10. ACM review

| Topic | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| CloudFront certificates | Must be **us-east-1**; SAN cover all SPA hosts |
| API / ALB certificates | Regional ACM via `forge-edge-tls.ts` when `edge.enableHttps` |
| Current enablement | Development edge HTTPS often **off**; production hosts not wired |
| Renewal | ACM auto-renew when DNS validated |
| Wildcard | Optional `*.forgepublicsafety.com` — decide before launch |

**Do not request/alter production certs in this sprint.**

---

## 11. WAF / edge security

| Topic | Finding |
| --- | --- |
| ALB WAF | AWS Managed Common Rule Set when `enableWaf` (on in production profile) |
| CloudFront WAF | **Not** established as associated — GAP |
| Rate limiting | Need explicit launch rules for auth and API |
| Admin route exposure | Creator Console behind Cognito; ensure WAF + auth both apply |
| Exploit baseline | Managed CRS present; expand with OWASP / IP reputation for launch |

---

## 12. Observability plan

| Signal | Plan |
| --- | --- |
| CloudWatch logs | KMS-encrypted groups (API, worker, DB, WAF, migration) |
| Metrics / dashboards | `forge-monitoring.ts` dashboard + import/config ops dashboards |
| API 5xx / latency | ALB + optional CF 5xx alarms; add latency alarms for launch |
| DB errors / CPU / connections | Existing CPU + connections alarms |
| Auth failures | App logs + Cognito metrics; add anomaly alarm |
| Billing webhook failures | App logs; alarm when billing live |
| Email failures | Noop today — add SES bounce/complaint + app send failures when SES live |
| Background jobs | Worker task count + SQS DLQ / age / backlog alarms |

---

## 13. Launch alarms (required)

Already present (names are logical): UnhealthyTargets, Api5xx, DbHighCpu, DbConnections, Imports/Notifications/Documents/Integration DLQs, Imports backlog/age, Api/Worker RunningTasks, optional CF 5xx.

**Must add / wire before launch:**

| Alarm | Trigger intent |
| --- | --- |
| API elevated latency | p95/p99 over threshold |
| Auth anomaly | Spike in 401/403 or Cognito failures |
| Billing webhook failure | Provider ingest errors (when enabled) |
| Email send failure | SES / provider failures (when enabled) |
| SNS subscription | Real on-call endpoint on `forge-{env}-sns-alarms` |

---

## 14. Backup / recovery

| Item | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Aurora automated backups | Production profile **35** days retention |
| AWS Backup plan | Daily rule; construct `deleteAfter: 14` days (align with policy before launch) |
| PITR | Aurora continuous backup window — use for migrate rollback |
| S3 versioning | Enabled on data buckets |
| Config recovery | CDK synth/deploy from git; secrets retained |
| Infra recreation | CDK app `@forge/infrastructure-cdk` |
| Firebase source retention | **Required** until AWS cutover accepted (`docs/program/governance.md`) |

---

## 15. Disaster recovery

| Topic | Documented assumption |
| --- | --- |
| Restore procedure | Snapshot / PITR restore to new cluster → re-point secrets → migrate verify → redeploy tasks → smoke |
| Critical dependencies | Cognito, Aurora, Secrets Manager, KMS, S3, CF, SES (future), DNS/ACM |
| RPO / RTO | **Not measured** — CONDITION; run restore drill |
| Emergency rollback | Prior ECS task definition + CF/S3 prior object versions + DNS revert; DB only via restore |
| Multi-region | `secondaryRegion` declared; **no** multi-region stacks yet — RTO assumes single-region rebuild |

---

## 16. Production deployment sequence

Adapt to discovered stacks (`bin/forge-platform.ts`):

| Stage | Action | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Prerequisite AWS account, OIDC deploy role, networking | Config validated |
| B | Secrets (DB master/app) + KMS | Secrets exist; no values in CI logs |
| C | Database backup / PITR checkpoint | Restore point recorded |
| D | Schema migrations (ECS migrate, admin secret) | Status OK; RLS verify |
| E | Platform API (ECS service) | `/health` green |
| F | Background workers | RunningTaskCount + DLQ quiet |
| G | Cognito / auth config confirmation | Callbacks match production domains |
| H | S3 / storage confirmation | Buckets private + encrypted |
| I | Frontend static sync (console, RMS, tenant-admin) | Sync complete |
| J | CloudFront invalidation | Invalidation complete |
| K | DNS / domain aliases (only when authorized) | Certs ISSUED |
| L | External webhooks (billing/CAD) | Secrets set; test ingest |
| M | Smoke testing (section 18) | Checklist signed |
| N | Production UAT (section 19) | Checklist signed |

**MK-S23 does not execute this sequence.**

---

## 17. Rollback plan (by stage)

| Stage | Trigger | Action | Data implications | Verify |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Migrate | Failed DDL / verify | Stop; PITR/snapshot restore | Data rewound | Migrate status + RLS |
| API / worker | Health / 5xx spike | ECS previous task def (circuit breaker may auto-roll) | None if schema compat | `/health`, auth |
| Frontend | Bad UI | Re-sync prior artifact + invalidate | None | Page load, login |
| CloudFront / DNS | Mis-route | Revert alias / distribution config | Traffic path only | Edge curl HTTPS |
| Secrets rotation mistake | Auth/DB fail | Restore previous secret version | Brief reconnect | DB connect / Cognito |

**Database compatibility:** App rollback without schema down-migrate only if schema remains backward compatible.

---

## 18. Smoke test plan (post-deploy)

Non-production first; production only under separate authorization.

| Check | Pass criteria |
| --- | --- |
| App loads | Creator Console, Tenant Admin, RMS shells 200 |
| Login / logout | Cognito hosted UI / app flows succeed |
| Tenant selection | `/api/v1/auth/me` + select-tenant |
| RBAC | Admin allowed; restricted role denied |
| Module entitlements | Disabled module denied |
| Notifications | In-app list (email optional until SES) |
| Storage | Upload/download or branding asset signed URL |
| APIs | Key platform GETs 200 with authZ |
| Billing | Overview read-only if enabled; **no** live charge tests without approval |
| Audit | Recent events visible for admin |

---

## 19. Post-deploy UAT (production-safe)

- Prefer read-only probes and synthetic tenants  
- Do **not** mutate real customer records unnecessarily  
- Reuse MK-S22 lifecycle steps only against synthetic tenant  
- Sign evidence into change ticket  

**Blocked from claiming complete** until MK-S22 e2e condition is resolved in non-prod (A or B).

---

## 20. Customer data migration readiness (dependency)

MK-S23 documents dependency only — **does not** perform Firebase → AWS customer migration.

| Dependency | Notes | Docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Firestore | Still SoT for Academy / some products | `docs/discovery/data-migration-inventory.md` |
| Firebase Auth | Cognito cutover separate; industrial P2 evidence paths | `docs/discovery/firebase-inventory.md`, ind-11 auth evidence |
| Firebase Storage | S3 copy/cutover separate | ind-11 storage evidence |
| Reconciliation | Required before authoritative AWS SoT | Industrial/program cutover plans |
| Final delta / cutover | Requires explicit authorization | `docs/program/governance.md` |
| Firebase rollback / read-only retention | Retain Firebase until AWS accepted; no silent delete | governance + coexistence decisions |

---

## 21. Architecture / security / AWS readiness summary

| Domain | Score |
| --- | --- |
| Architecture (shared Aurora + RLS + ECS + CF) | READY (pattern) |
| Environment | CONDITION / GAP (prod placeholders, APP_ENV) |
| AWS IaC | CONDITION |
| Security (AuthZ, RLS, WAF baseline) | CONDITION (CF WAF, least privilege) |
| Database | CONDITION (migrate plan ready; restore drill GAP) |
| Deployment sequence | READY (documented) — execution NOT authorized |
| Rollback | CONDITION (doc ready; drills pending) |
| Monitoring / alarms | CONDITION (SNS subscribers + latency/auth/email) |
| Backups | CONDITION (construct ready; drill GAP) |
| Email / SES | GAP |
| MK-S22 E2E | OUTSTANDING |

---

## 22. Production blockers

1. **MK-S22 full HTTP E2E** not executed against isolated test DB (local or CI evidence).  
2. **SES** noop/stub — no production email.  
3. **Production CDK config** placeholders (account, Cognito URLs, domains).  
4. **ECS `APP_ENV` hardcoded** to `development`.  
5. **No production deploy CI / approval guard**.  
6. **Backup restore drill** not evidenced.  
7. **ALB HTTPS / ACM / DNS** production front-door not finalized.  
8. **CloudFront WAF** not established.  
9. **SNS on-call subscribers** placeholder.  
10. **Firebase → AWS customer-data cutover** not complete (separate authorization).

---

## 23. Launch prerequisites (checklist)

- [ ] MK-S22 `test:e2e` PASS with retained evidence (A or B)  
- [ ] SES verified + live provider + IAM  
- [ ] Production account/domains/Cognito URLs real  
- [ ] ECS task env `APP_ENV` = production  
- [ ] Production OIDC deploy + human approval  
- [ ] Pre-launch backup + restore drill signed  
- [ ] ACM issued for all SPA + API hostnames  
- [ ] DNS cutover plan + rollback owner  
- [ ] WAF rate limits + CF WAF decision  
- [ ] Alarm SNS → on-call  
- [ ] Least-privilege IAM review signed  
- [ ] Explicit **production authorization** for deploy/migrate/DNS  
- [ ] Customer data migration/cutover authorization (if serving migrated tenants)

---

## Verdict (directive allowed values)

```text
NOT READY
```

Rationale: MK-S22 E2E condition OUTSTANDING + CRITICAL blockers (SES, prod config, APP_ENV, prod deploy path). Platform is production-*shaped* and this sprint completed planning/docs only.

---

## Explicit non-goals honored

- No production deploy, migrate, or AWS resource mutation  
- No deferred BACKLOG implementation  
- No unrelated features  
- No silent upgrade of MK-S22 to clean PASS  
- No Firebase customer-data migration execution
