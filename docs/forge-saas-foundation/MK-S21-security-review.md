# MK-S21 Security Review — FORGE-SAAS-CORE

**Program:** FORGE-SAAS-CORE  
**Sprint:** MK-S21  
**Date:** 2026-08-11  
**Production operations:** NONE  
**Repair passes used:** 1  

## Verdict

**PASS** after repair pass 1. All CRITICAL and HIGH findings from the red-team review are resolved in code (or reduced below HIGH with residual MEDIUM/INFO backlog). Cross-tenant path/RLS, invitations, session revoke, and branding ownership remain defended.

Severity scale: CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW | INFO

## CRITICAL findings

### S21-C1 — Role permission swap → platform admin

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | **RESOLVED** (repair pass 1) |
| Was | VULNERABLE |
| Severity | CRITICAL |

**Exploit (pre-fix):** Tenant admin creates a custom role, assigns it to self, then `PUT` permissions includes `platform.tenant.create` + `platform.tenant.suspend` + `platform.entitlement.manage`, triggering `isPlatformAdmin` heuristic.

**Fix:**
- `AuthorizationService.setRolePermissions` / `assignRole` enforce creator-only + caller-must-hold rules (same shape as memberships `assertGrantable`)
- Regression tests: `authorization.escalation.test.ts`

---

## HIGH findings

### S21-H1 — Suspended tenant self-reactivation

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | **RESOLVED** (repair pass 1) |
| Was | PARTIAL bypass |
| Severity | HIGH |

**Exploit (pre-fix):** Owner holds `platform.tenant.update` with `allowWhenSuspended` and calls `POST …/tenants/:id/activate`.

**Fix:** Activate requires `platform.tenant.suspend` (creator-only), matching suspend.

### S21-H2 — Module/product entitlement self-serve

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | **RESOLVED** (repair pass 1) |
| Was | PARTIAL |
| Severity | HIGH |

**Exploit (pre-fix):** Tenant owner held `platform.entitlement.manage` and could assign unpaid modules while suspended.

**Fix:**
- `platform.entitlement.manage` added to `CREATOR_ONLY_PERMISSIONS`
- Removed from `TENANT_OWNER_PERMISSIONS` / `TENANT_ADMIN`
- Migration `0038_mk_s21_security_hardening.sql` strips template + TENANT_OWNER/ADMIN role bindings (not applied prod)

### S21-H3 — Creator Console surface for tenant personas

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Status | **HARDENED** |
| Severity | HIGH → LOW residual |

Entitlement-write Creator APIs are now creator-only. Residual: tenant owners still hold some `platform.*` read/manage codes by design for Tenant Admin; UI gates are non-authoritative. Catalog list remains behind `platform.tenant.read`.

---

## MEDIUM residuals (documented, not blocking PASS)

| ID | Topic | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S21-M1 | Facility substitution | Membership facility IDs validated on invite; not enforced on all resource queries |
| S21-M2 | Outbound webhook replay | HMAC without timestamp/nonce; CAD inbound has replay cache |
| S21-M3 | API keys unused for auth | Lifecycle is safe; request auth not wired |
| S21-M4 | Missing `@RequirePermission` | PermissionGuard no-ops when decorator absent (e.g. search) |

---

## DEFENDED (evidence)

| Vector | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-tenant + URL substitution | AuthGuard membership bind; TenantGuard; RLS `withTenantTransaction`; `packages/authorization` TENANT_MISMATCH tests; `tenant-isolation.integration.test.ts` |
| Invitation expiry/revocation | `invitations.service.ts` + `invitations.security.test.ts` |
| Session revoke | `sessionsRevokedAt` vs JWT `iat`; `auth-context.security.test.ts` |
| Branding file ownership | Object key + tenant checks; `branding-ownership.test.ts` |
| Body tenant mismatch (invitations) | `invitations.security.test.ts` |

---

## Code / migration changes (MK-S21)

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| AuthorizationService | Permission assignability checks on set/assign |
| TenantsController | Activate → `platform.tenant.suspend` |
| contracts | `platform.entitlement.manage` creator-only; owner template stripped |
| drizzle | `0038_mk_s21_security_hardening.sql` |
| tests | `authorization.escalation.test.ts` |

---

## Explicit non-goals

- Live production penetration
- Industrial-only red team
- Production migrate/deploy
- Full facility ACL (BACKLOG-016)
- API-key request authentication productization
