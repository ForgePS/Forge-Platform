# Threat Model — AI Narrative Assistant

**Status:** Foundation (stub provider; flags off)  
**Related:** [../ai/security.md](../ai/security.md), [sensitive-data.md](./sensitive-data.md)

## Assets

| Asset | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Source field values | Incident/investigation/evaluation facts |
| Generated drafts | May paraphrase sensitive operational detail |
| Provider credentials | Secret ARNs only; not in foundation runtime path |
| Audit / usage records | Evidence of who requested/accepted what |
| Tenant isolation boundary | Cross-tenant leakage is critical severity |

## Trust boundaries

1. Browser / product UI → `platform-api` (authn/authz)
2. Application → database (RLS, tenant scope)
3. Application → AI provider (none in production foundation; stub local only)
4. Application → logs/metrics (must stay free of restricted payloads)

## Key threats and mitigations

| ID | Threat | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Prompt injection exfiltrates other records | Tenant-scoped source manifest only; no tool calling; fail closed on flags/permissions |
| T2 | Restricted PII/PHI sent to model | Classification gate + redaction; RESTRICTED blocked by default |
| T3 | Hallucinated facts accepted silently | Human accept required; draft labels; evaluation heuristics; anti-hallucination prompts |
| T4 | Auto-submit to NERIS/ePCR | Explicitly out of scope; no such code paths in foundation |
| T5 | Product modules embed provider SDKs | Provider abstraction; SDK import ban in product packages |
| T6 | Flags enabled on Phase 4 synthetic tenant | Defaults false; Phase 4 acceptance must not enable |
| T7 | Over-collection / training on customer data | Analytics flag off; purpose limitation in privacy docs |
| T8 | Cost / DoS via generation spam | Quotas, cost ceiling, rate-oriented policy defaults |
| T9 | Secrets in logs or tickets | Observability helpers; IR guidance forbids pasting bodies |
| T10 | Privilege escalation via policy PATCH | Policy mutation API reserved / fail-closed |

## Out of scope (this revision)

- Production LLM provider compromise analysis (no live provider)
- Model supply-chain attestation for third-party models
- Phase 5 product UX threat modeling

## Residual risk

Stub-only foundation residual risk is low while flags remain off. Enabling any production provider without completing Phase 5 authorization would materially increase residual risk (data egress, cost, hallucination impact).
