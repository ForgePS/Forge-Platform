# Import Platform — Access Control Matrix (S8)

**Document:** `docs/security/import-access-control-matrix.md`  
**Enforcement:** Platform API (`forgeAuth`) — UI matrix is advisory only  
**OpenAPI:** `docs/api/import-openapi.yaml` (`0.6.0-s6`)

## Permission catalog

| Permission | Intent |
| --- | --- |
| `import.view` | Read jobs, status, scan events, masked downloads |
| `import.upload` | Create upload sessions, complete/abort, some file ops |
| `import.map` | Put/update column mappings |
| `import.validate` | Validation requests, malware rescan |
| `import.preview` | Preview generation / read |
| `import.approve` | Submit / approve / reject |
| `import.execute` | Execute import, cancel execution |
| `import.rollback` | Rollback classification request |
| `import.profile.manage` | Create/update/archive profiles |
| `import.template.manage` | Template management |
| `import.error.reprocess` | Reprocess eligible row errors |
| `import.sensitive` | Request privileged (still non-secret) downloads |

## Capability matrix

| Capability | view | upload | map | validate | preview | approve | execute | rollback | profile.manage | template.manage | error.reprocess | sensitive |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| List/get jobs, status, results UI | ✓ | | | | | | | | | | | |
| Masked artifact download | ✓ | | | | | | | | | | | |
| Privileged download flag | ✓* | | | | | | | | | | | ✓ |
| Upload initialize/complete/abort | | ✓ | | | | | | | | | | |
| Save mappings | | | ✓ | | | | | | | | | |
| Validate / rescan | | | | ✓ | | | | | | | | |
| Preview | | | | | ✓ | | | | | | | |
| Approve / reject | | | | | | ✓ | | | | | | |
| Execute / cancel | | | | | | | ✓ | | | | | |
| Rollback request | | | | | | | | ✓ | | | | |
| Manage profiles | | | | | | | | | ✓ | | | |
| Manage templates | | | | | | | | | | ✓ | | |
| Reprocess errors | | | | | | | | | | | ✓ | |
| Malware override | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Quarantine release | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |
| Bypass Outcome B scanner block | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — | — |

\* Privileged download also requires `import.view` (or route’s view-equivalent) plus `import.sensitive` when `privileged=true`. Credentials remain non-returnable.

Some routes accept alternate permissions (e.g. certain file ops allow `import.upload` **or** `import.approve`). Treat OpenAPI `security` arrays as source of truth per operation.

## Role guidance (interim)

| Persona | Typical grants |
| --- | --- |
| Tenant viewer | `import.view` |
| Tenant importer | `view` + `upload` + `map` + `validate` + `preview` |
| Tenant approver | above + `approve` |
| Tenant executor | above + `execute` (+ `rollback` if policy allows) |
| Profile admin | `profile.manage` (+ `view`) |
| Template admin | `template.manage` (+ `view`) |
| Sensitive reviewer | `view` + `sensitive` |
| Support (read) | `view` only — no execute/replay |

Exact role bindings live in platform RBAC seed data — keep this matrix aligned when roles change.

## Negative controls

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-tenant job id | RLS / not found — no leakage |
| Execute without CLEAN gate | Denied / security hold |
| Reference scanner in production-like `APP_ENV` | `IMPORT_SCANNER_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` |
| Override infected | No endpoint |
