# Audit Logging

**Sprint:** 1D  
**Related ADRs:** [ADR-015](../decisions/ADR-015-permission-based-authorization.md), [ADR-016](../decisions/ADR-016-outbox-pattern.md)

## Purpose

Platform mutations write **tenant-scoped audit events** in the same database transaction as the business change. Audit is complementary to domain events: audit answers “who did what to which resource,” while the outbox answers “what should downstream systems react to” ([ADR-016](../decisions/ADR-016-outbox-pattern.md)).

## Record shape

Built via `@forge/audit` `buildAuditRecord` / `AuditService.writeInTransaction`:

| Field | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `tenantId` | Owning tenant |
| `actorUserId` / `actorPersonId` / `actorType` | Who acted |
| `action` | Verb (create, update, suspend, …) |
| `resourceType` / `resourceId` | Target |
| `organizationId` | Optional org scope |
| `result` / `riskLevel` | Outcome and sensitivity |
| `beforeJson` / `afterJson` | Redacted snapshots |
| `metadataJson` | Extra context (no plaintext secrets) |
| `correlationId` / `requestId` | Request tracing |
| `ipAddress` / `userAgent` | Client metadata when available |
| `occurredAt` | Event time |

Sensitive keys in snapshots should be redacted (`@forge/audit` / `@forge/security` helpers).

## API

`api/v1/tenants/:tenantId/audit-events` (requires `platform.audit.read`):

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/` | Paginated list |
| GET | `/:auditEventId` | Single event |
| POST | `/export` | Export request (foundation) |

Creator console page: `/audit` (tenant query param required).

## When to write

Write an audit row for:

- Tenant lifecycle (activate, suspend, archive)
- Person create/update/merge/archive and sensitive-identifier access
- User invite/enable/disable and role assignment changes
- Entitlement, subscription, feature, and configuration changes
- Other privileged platform mutations

Prefer writing inside the domain transaction so a failed commit rolls back the audit row too.

## Authorization decisions

Fine-grained allow/deny evaluation may also persist to `authorization_decision_log` for high-risk paths ([ADR-015](../decisions/ADR-015-permission-based-authorization.md)). That log is RLS-scoped and separate from `audit_events`.

## Retention and archive

Sprint 1D stores audit in Aurora. Long-term archive to the audit S3 bucket (infra from Sprint 1C) is operational follow-up — not claimed complete here.
