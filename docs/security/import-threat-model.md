# Import Platform — Threat Model (S8)

**Document:** `docs/security/import-threat-model.md`  
**Method:** Practical STRIDE-oriented summary bound to shipped controls

## Assets

| Asset | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| Uploaded files | Tenant confidential; may contain PII / credentials |
| Import rows / mappings / previews | Tenant confidential |
| Execution journal | Integrity-critical operational |
| Scan events / verdicts | Security evidence |
| Presigned URLs | Short-lived capability tokens |
| Queue messages | Identifiers only (still tenant-sensitive ids) |

See `docs/security/import-data-classification.md`.

## Actors

| Actor | Intent |
| --- | --- |
| Tenant operator | Legitimate import within entitlements |
| Malicious tenant user | Cross-tenant read/write, privilege escalation |
| External attacker | Upload malware, abuse presigns, scrape APIs |
| Insider / support | Over-broad access, unsafe DLQ replay |
| Compromised worker | Replay commits, exfiltrate S3 |

## Threats and mitigations

| ID | Threat | Mitigation | Residual |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T1 | Cross-tenant data access | FORCE RLS; tenant session; API authZ | Browser cache evidence incomplete (LIM-IMP-012) |
| T2 | Malware upload / execution | Scan gate; quarantine; fail-closed execute | Reference scanner only — **Outcome B** blocks prod-like |
| T3 | Override infected → execute | No override HTTP; UI unavailable | Pressure for unsafe ops procedures |
| T4 | Presign leakage | Short TTL; no queue URLs; client dispose | Browser disposal evidence OPEN |
| T5 | Sensitive field disclosure | Masking; `import.sensitive`; credentials never returned | Heuristic sensitivity (LIM-IMP-007) |
| T6 | Duplicate commits on retry | Execution journal + idempotency keys | Adapter correctness for future products |
| T7 | Poison queue / DLQ abuse | maxReceiveCount; inspect without Body; confirm replay | Operator error on replay |
| T8 | Privilege escalation via UI-only checks | Server enforces `import.*` | Misconfigured role grants |
| T9 | Assuming SFN security gate is live | Option B inactive; gates in API/worker | Doc drift / false ops assumptions |
| T10 | Production imports with reference scanner | `assertScannerAllowedForEnvironment` | Mis-set `APP_ENV` labeling |

## Abuse cases

1. **Upload EICAR / synthetic signals in development** — expected quarantine/fail paths for tests.  
2. **Attempt upload in staging with reference provider** — must fail with `IMPORT_SCANNER_PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE`.  
3. **DLQ redrive of quarantined job** — forbidden without security review.  
4. **Privileged download without `import.sensitive`** — API denies.  
5. **Force COMPLETED on stuck job** — prohibited; stuck-job runbook is non-destructive.

## Acceptance constraints

- Outcome B remains until Outcome A provider authorized.  
- No product adapters expand write surface in S8.  
- Threat model updates required when scanner provider or SFN activation lands.
