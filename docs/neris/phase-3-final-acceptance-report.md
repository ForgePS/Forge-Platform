# NERIS Phase 3 — Final Acceptance Report

**Decision:** `ACCEPTED`  
**Report date:** 2026-07-26 (limitation closeout)  
**Environment:** AWS development (`511343547817` / `us-east-1`)  
**Prepared by:** Engineering (agent-assisted closeout)  
**Phase 4:** Not started (explicit stop)

---

## 1. Executive summary

Phase 3 specialty workflows completed limitation closeout on the preserved Forge-Development-Compute deployment (API task revision **16**). Dedicated Cognito Playwright suites for scenarios **2–9**, the attachment matrix, specialty mobile viewports, and specialty accessibility checks all **PASS**. Full RMS e2e regression is **34/34 passed** (20 `@phase3` + Phase 2 suite). Product owner sign-off is still required below (not forged).

---

## 2. Phase decision

| Decision | Selected |
| --- | --- |
| **ACCEPTED** | **Yes — engineering evidence gates met** |
| ACCEPTED_WITH_LIMITATIONS | No — scenarios 2–9 and matrices closed |
| INCOMPLETE | No |

**Engineering gates satisfied:** scenarios 1–10 PASS; attachment, cross-tenant, restricted casualty, finalization, and feature-disabled tests PASS; no Critical/Serious a11y findings in deployed specialty suite; Playwright required tests zero skips/failures; Phase 2 regression PASS; API/RMS healthy after testing.

**Human product status:** Product owner must still sign the section below. Until that signature exists, operational release judgment remains with Jeremy Powell.

---

## 3. Scope completed

- Specialty workflow engine (14 groups) + live form descriptor + section API
- Feature flag default false; override only `rms-synthetic-fd`
- Repeatable records, attachments (quarantine-default scanner), occupancy/preplan, proposals
- Specialty validation, permissions, casualty masking + access audit
- Specialty review UI/API
- GAP-009 Compute deploy path preserved (no Data stack deploy)
- Migrations `0011` / `0012` preserved; runtime `forge_app`; app secret unchanged
- Playwright Phase 3 scenarios 1–10 + attachment/mobile/a11y matrices

---

## 4. Scope deferred

CAD, external NERIS submit, offline sync, AI narrative, ePCR, IRWIN, production onboarding, SOC 2 Type 1/2 claims, deployed malware clearing service (quarantine-only remains an operational limitation), GAP-009 Data stack import.

---

## 5. Workflow groups completed

All 14 groups remain implemented in `@forge/neris`. Deployed Cognito scenarios exercised FIRE/STRUCTURE/EXPOSURES, CIVILIAN_CASUALTIES, FIRE_SERVICE_CASUALTIES, HAZMAT, ALARM_DETECTION, FIRE_PROTECTION activation and review paths.

---

## 30–32. HTTPS / CloudWatch / CloudTrail

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| AWS account / region | **511343547817** / **us-east-1** (verified `sts get-caller-identity`) |
| API health | **PASS** — HTTP **200** `{"status":"healthy",...}` (sampled **2026-07-27T10:24:45Z**) |
| RMS CloudFront | **PASS** — HTTP **200** (same sample window) |
| ECS API task | **PASS** — `forge-development-ecs-platform-api:16`, running **1/1**, container **HEALTHY**, deployment COMPLETED, failedTasks **0** |
| Runtime DB secret reference | **PASS** — task env `DATABASE_SECRET_ARN` → `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-east-1:511343547817:secret:forge-development-secrets-database-app` |
| App secret LastChangedDate | **Unchanged** — `2026-07-26T15:30:16-05:00` (not regenerated) |
| CloudTrail `forge-development-cloudtrail-management` | **PASS** — `IsLogging=true`; LatestDeliveryTime **2026-07-27T05:21:35-05:00** |
| CloudWatch `forge-development-alarm-*` | **PASS** for API/ECS/DB/5xx family — see note for SSO directory alarm |
| Unexpected ECS failures | **None** — no STOPPED tasks for API service; latest event steady state **2026-07-27T02:28:26-05:00** |
| Unexpected API 5xx increase | **None** — `forge-development-alarm-api-5xx` and `forge-development-alarm-api-cf-5xx` remain **OK** |

**Fresh evidence note (SSO re-sample):** After refreshing `forge-dev` SSO, operational baseline re-verified **2026-07-27 ~05:24 CDT / 10:24 UTC**. No stacks deployed; Data stack not touched; secrets not replaced.

**Alarm note:** `forge-development-alarm-sso-directory-changes` is **ALARM** (updated **2026-07-27T05:23:25-05:00**) coincident with SSO session refresh / directory activity. This is expected control noise from the verification login path, not an API or ECS failure. All other listed `forge-development-alarm-*` alarms were **OK** at sample time (including `api-5xx`, `api-cf-5xx`, `api-running-tasks`, `api-unhealthy`, CloudTrail stop/delete/update).

---

## 33. Deployment results

| Stack / action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `Forge-Development-Data` | **Not deployed** (GAP-009 protected) |
| Compute / API `:16` | **Preserved** (no redeploy this closeout) |
| Migrations `0011`/`0012` | **Preserved** |
| Feature flag | Default false; synthetic tenant A only |
| App secret | **Not replaced** |

---

## 34. Cost impact

Test-only synthetic traffic; no new long-lived stacks. Quarantined attachment objects may accumulate under normal use.

---

## 35. Known limitations

1. Malware scanning remains interface-only (`QuarantineDefaultMalwareScanner` → never CLEARED). Users must not treat quarantined files as trusted — UI/API `clearedForUse=false` enforced in tests.
2. **GAP-009** Data stack still cannot be deployed until secret import is adopted in Data CDK.
3. Same-tenant limited-role (non-admin) Cognito user is not provisioned; unauthorized casualty proof uses cross-tenant + masked list semantics.
4. Accessibility Medium/Minor (owners/dates):
   - **M1** — Specialty review comment/assign controls density on phone landscape: Owner Engineering; Target 2026-08-15 (monitor; no Critical/Serious).
   - **M2** — Full axe scan against every specialty dialog variant not automated in Playwright: Owner Engineering; Target 2026-08-31.
5. `forge-development-alarm-sso-directory-changes` may ALARM when operators refresh SSO; treat as expected unless unrelated Identity Center changes occur.

---

## 36. Open risks

| Risk | Severity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GAP-009 Data CDK drift | Medium | Keep `--exclusively` for Compute until import |
| Quarantine-only attachments | Medium | Operational labeling required |
| SSO directory-change alarm noise | Low | Expected on operator SSO refresh; correlate before escalating |

---

## 37. Recommended Phase 4

Do **not** start Phase 4 until product signs this report. Phase 4 candidates remain authorization-gated: external NERIS submit, CAD, offline, AI narrative, ePCR, IRWIN.

---

## 38. Human product sign-off section

Retain human decision blank until signed. Engineering recommendation: **ACCEPTED** for development use of specialty workflows on `rms-synthetic-fd` only.

| Role | Name | Date | Decision | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Product owner | Jeremy Powell, Founder, Forge Public Safety | | | Sign to confirm ACCEPTED (or reject / retain WITH_LIMITATIONS) |
| Engineering lead | | | | |
| Security reviewer | | | | |

**Do not forge approval.** Product status for human acceptance remains unsigned until Jeremy Powell completes this table.
