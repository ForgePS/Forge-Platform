# NERIS Phase 4 — Implementation Plan

**Created:** 2026-07-27  
**Authorization:** Phase 4 master Cursor build directive (CAD, hybrid intake, ingestion, matching, conflicts, operations)  
**AWS development account:** `511343547817` · **Region:** `us-east-1`  
**Status:** PLAN COMPLETE — coding not started  
**Phase 5:** NOT AUTHORIZED

SOC 2 remains a **readiness program** only. Do not claim certification, compliance, audit completion, Type 1, or Type 2.

---

## 1. Mission summary

Build a vendor-neutral CAD integration and hybrid incident-intake system inside Forge RMS. CAD is a **source of operational information**. Every CAD-created incident becomes a normal Forge NERIS incident using the existing incident model, numbering, workflow, specialty engine, validation, review, finalization, permissions, audit, RLS, and attachments.

Do **not** build a second reporting system. Do **not** begin Phase 5. Synthetic CAD data only. Development AWS account only.

## 2. Repository inventory (pre-coding)

### 2.1 Monorepo layout

| Area | Location | Phase 4 relevance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspaces | `pnpm-workspace.yaml` → `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `infrastructure/*` | New CAD packages under `packages/` |
| API | `apps/platform-api` (NestJS) | New CAD modules |
| Worker | `apps/worker-service` (ECS Fargate) | CAD queue processors (not Lambda) |
| RMS Web | `apps/rms-web` | Ops dashboard, config, incident CAD UI |
| Creator Console | `apps/creator-console` | Adapter/mapping templates, simulator admin |
| E2E | `apps/rms-web-e2e` (`@forge/rms-web-e2e`) | `@phase4` Cognito scenarios |
| Database | `packages/database` | Migrations **0013+** (latest applied pattern: **0012**) |
| Contracts | `packages/contracts` | Permissions, flags, API schemas |
| NERIS engine | `packages/neris` | Specialty/validation reuse; no vendor fields |
| Events / audit | `packages/events`, `packages/audit` | Domain + audit event types |
| AuthZ | `packages/authorization` | Feature flag resolution |
| CDK | `infrastructure/cdk` | Queues, IAM, alarms, optional CAD S3 prefix |
| Scripts | `scripts/run-ecs-migrate.mjs`, seed scripts | Approved migration path |

### 2.2 Existing components to reuse

| Component | Path / pattern | How Phase 4 uses it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Intake mode enum | `tenant_neris_configuration.operating_mode` (`MANUAL_ONLY` \| `CAD_ENABLED` \| `HYBRID`) in `0007` + Zod overlay | Source of truth for intake mode; extend with CAD config columns |
| Incident shell | `neris-incidents` module + `0010` schema | CAD creates/updates via existing create/update services — no parallel incident store |
| Incident numbering | `incident-numbering.service.ts` | Reserve number inside CAD create transaction |
| Field values + prefill | `neris_incident_field_values`, `PREFILL_SOURCES` incl. `FUTURE_CAD` | Promote `FUTURE_CAD` → `CAD` provenance; extend ownership |
| Form descriptor / specialty | `@forge/neris` + form-descriptor service | Activate workflows after CAD shell create |
| Validation / review / finalize | Existing Phase 2–3 APIs | Non-blocking validation; finalized lock blocks CAD mutation |
| Feature flags | Seed `FEATURE_DEFINITIONS` + `FeatureFlagsService` + `FeatureGate` | New `rms.cad.*` flags default **false** |
| Permissions | `RMS_PERMISSIONS` → seed → `@RequirePermission` | New `rms.cad.*` / `platform.cad.*` |
| Audit | `AuditService.writeInTransaction` + `@forge/audit` redaction | CAD audit actions; raw-payload access = high sensitivity |
| Idempotency | ADR-022 durable idempotency + `@Idempotent` | HTTP + processing keys |
| Optimistic concurrency | `record_version` / If-Match (ADR-023) | Connections, links, conflicts, mappings |
| RLS / FORCE RLS | `rls.sql.ts` + migration loops; runtime `forge_app` | All CAD tables |
| Outbox / EventBridge | Worker outbox → domain bus → `integration-events` SQS | Emit `rms.neris.cad.*.v1` style events |
| SQS queue-pair construct | `forge-queues.ts` `queuePair()` | Add CAD intake / normalize / match / apply + DLQ |
| Document S3 pattern | `DocumentStorageService`, KMS, tenant-prefixed keys | Raw CAD payloads (separate prefix or bucket config) |
| Secrets Manager | ARN in config/DB; resolve at runtime (ADR-011) | Webhook + connection credential ARNs only — **never** values in JSONB |
| App DB secret | `forge-development-secrets-database-app` | **Do not replace/rotate/recreate** |
| Worker processors | `apps/worker-service/src/processors/` | CAD consumers alongside existing SQS consumer |
| Playwright Cognito | `rms-web-e2e` globalSetup, tags in describe titles | Mirror `@phase3` → `@phase4` |
| Synthetic tenants | A `rms-synthetic-fd`, B `rms-synthetic-fd-b` | Flags on A only; cross-tenant tests with B |

### 2.3 CAD stubs today (greenfield beyond these)

- `operating_mode` accepts `CAD_ENABLED` / `HYBRID` but **no runtime branching**
- `PREFILL_SOURCES` includes `FUTURE_CAD` (unused by prefill service)
- **No** adapters, webhooks, CAD tables, CAD queues, CAD UI, CAD flags, or CAD permissions
- NERIS dictionary fields such as `dispatch_cad_software` are schema metadata only

### 2.4 Naming conventions (adapted from directive)

Directive suggested folders are adapted to this repo:

| Concern | This repository | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Packages | `packages/cad-contracts`, `packages/cad-core`, `packages/cad-adapters`, `packages/cad-simulator` | Clear vendor-neutral boundaries; workspace already allows `packages/*` |
| API modules | `apps/platform-api/src/modules/cad/` with subfolders (`connections`, `messages`, `mapping`, `matching`, `conflicts`, `operations`, `webhooks`, `simulator`) | Matches Nest kebab modules; avoids stuffing vendor logic into `neris-incidents` |
| Incident application bridge | Thin calls from CAD application worker into existing `NerisIncidentsService` | CAD must not fork incident ownership |
| Workers | `apps/worker-service/src/processors/cad-*.ts` | Single ECS worker service pattern — not separate `workers/` apps |
| Routes | Webhook: `POST /api/v1/cad/webhooks/:connectionPublicId`; tenant APIs: ` /api/v1/tenants/:tenantId/cad/...` **and** incident-scoped ` /api/v1/tenants/:tenantId/neris/incidents/:id/cad-*` | Aligns with Nest tenant routing while keeping public webhook IDs |
| Feature flags | Directive keys `rms.cad.*` / `platform.cad.*` | Follow authorization directive (distinct from `rms.neris.*`) |
| Permissions | Directive keys `rms.cad.*` / `platform.cad.*` | Same |
| Audit actions | `cad.connection.created`, `cad.message.received`, … (typed constants) | Match `@forge/audit` style with CAD namespace |
| Domain events | `rms.cad.*.v1` in `@forge/events` | Parallel to existing `rms.neris.*` |
| Migrations | `0013_cad_connections` … `0018_cad_operations_and_retention` | Sequential after `0012` |
| UI (ops) | `apps/rms-web` — Configuration → Integrations → CAD; Operations → CAD Operations | Tenant operators |
| UI (creator) | `apps/creator-console` — Integrations / CAD templates | Platform-only |
| E2E | `tests/phase-4-*.spec.ts` + `@phase4` / `@cad*` tags | Same tagging style as Phase 3 |
| ADRs | `docs/decisions/` or `docs/architecture/adr/` (next free ADR numbers) | Existing ADR homes |

---

## 3. Delivery increments

| Increment | Scope | Exit criteria (summary) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **4A** | Contracts, schema, connections, raw messages, normalized events, mapping profiles, flags, permissions, audit event types | Migrations applied in CI/dev schema tests; packages compile; seeds present; no webhook yet |
| **4B** | Secure webhook, auth, replay prevention, raw persist, queues, normalize worker, idempotency, DLQ | Signed webhook accepts/rejects; raw immutable; queue pipeline to NORMALIZED |
| **4C** | Matching, links, intake modes, manual link, provenance, ownership, conflicts, unit/personnel unknown queues | CREATE_NEW / UPDATE / HYBRID link; conflicts; MANUAL_ONLY unchanged |
| **4D** | Ops dashboard, connection UI, mapping admin, unknown queues, raw metadata, conflict UI, incident CAD panel | Feature-gated UI; no secrets/raw by default |
| **4E** | Simulator, polling framework, observability, alarms, retention worker, replay tools, runbooks | Synthetic scenarios runnable; metrics/alarms; retention audited |
| **4F** | Deploy, Cognito acceptance (30 scenarios), mobile, a11y, RLS, security, Phase 2/3 regression, final report | Definition of Done; stop — no Phase 5 |

After **every** increment: update status docs; lint; typecheck; unit tests; affected API/RLS tests; build; report completed / deferred / risks. Do not mark unverified work complete.

---

## 4. New components required

### 4.1 Packages

| Package | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `@forge/cad-contracts` | Types: adapter manifest, transports, raw/normalized events, acknowledgements, health, replay; Zod schemas shared by API/UI |
| `@forge/cad-core` | Matching engine, ownership rules, idempotency key generation, out-of-order policy, cutoff policy — **no vendor parsers** |
| `@forge/cad-adapters` | Adapter registry; synthetic adapter; interfaces for future vendors; `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` transports |
| `@forge/cad-simulator` | Scenario definitions + signed payload builders (usable by API and e2e) |

### 4.2 API modules (`apps/platform-api/src/modules/cad/`)

| Submodule | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `connections` | CRUD, enable/disable, test, rotate-secret |
| `webhooks` | Public intake endpoint; HMAC; nonce/replay; persist; enqueue |
| `messages` | List/metadata; reprocess; quarantine; replay (restricted) |
| `mapping` | Profiles, rules, aliases, publish, unmapped resolve |
| `matching` | Manual link helpers; duplicate review APIs |
| `conflicts` | List/resolve/ignore/escalate |
| `operations` | Summary, metrics, health, queues, DLQ |
| `simulator` | Scenarios, send, outage, recover (flag-gated) |
| `unit-personnel` | Unit/personnel mappings + unknown queues |
| Bridge | Application service calling `NerisIncidentsService` only through approved APIs |

### 4.3 Worker processors

| Processor | Queue | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cad-intake` | cad-intake | Validate envelope; stage for normalize |
| `cad-normalization` | cad-normalization | Adapter parse + normalize + mapping |
| `cad-matching` | cad-matching | Match decision |
| `cad-application` | cad-application | Apply to NERIS incident in transaction |
| `cad-polling` | EventBridge schedule → poller | Polling adapters + simulator poll |
| `cad-retention` | Scheduled | Purge/archive per policy; audit |

Shared DLQ: `cad-dead-letter` (+ redrive / manual reprocess).

### 4.4 Frontend

**RMS Web**

- Configuration → Integrations → CAD (connections, unit/personnel/call-type mapping, unmapped, fallback settings, testing)
- Operations → CAD Operations (dashboard, filters, actions)
- Incident workspace: CAD status strip, provenance indicators, CAD timeline tab, conflict panel entry
- Duplicate review queue; unknown unit/personnel queues; manual fallback UX

**Creator Console**

- Adapter templates, mapping templates, source versions, transformation rules, simulator, global diagnostics  
- No tenant raw payloads without restricted support authorization

### 4.5 Database migrations (proposed)

| Migration | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `0013_cad_connections` | `cad_connections`, tenant CAD config extensions, intake-mode constraints, RLS |
| `0014_cad_messages_and_events` | `cad_raw_messages`, `cad_normalized_events`, comment timeline tables, RLS |
| `0015_cad_mapping` | profiles, rules, aliases, versions, unmapped values, RLS |
| `0016_cad_webhook_lookup` | SECURITY DEFINER `forge_lookup_cad_connection(public_id)` (ADR-029) |
| `0017_cad_incident_links_and_conflicts` | links, conflicts, field provenance extension, RLS |
| `0018_cad_unit_personnel_mapping` | unit/personnel mappings, unknown queues, unit events, RLS |
| `0019_cad_operations_and_retention` | fallback/outage records, retention metadata, health logs, RLS |

Each: forward-safe; FORCE RLS; indexes; constraints; verification notes; **no** app-secret or Aurora replacement.

### 4.6 Tenant configuration fields (extend existing NERIS config)

- `intake_mode` (existing `operating_mode` — keep single source of truth; alias in API docs)
- `allow_manual_creation_when_cad_enabled`
- `manual_override_requires_reason`
- `manual_override_permission`
- `cad_update_cutoff_policy`
- `duplicate_match_threshold` / `possible_duplicate_threshold` / `auto_link_threshold`
- `require_match_review`
- `preserve_cad_comments`
- `caller_data_retention` / `raw_payload_retention`
- `cad_quiet_hours` / `cad_expected_operating_window`

### 4.7 Infrastructure changes

| Resource | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| SQS | Extend `ForgeQueues` with cad-intake, cad-normalization, cad-matching, cad-application (+ DLQs); KMS; visibility tuned to worker duration |
| S3 | Raw payloads under `cad/{tenantId}/{connectionId}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/{rawMessageId}/payload` on documents bucket **or** dedicated prefix/config — no PII in keys |
| IAM | Least-privilege grant API send; worker consume/read-write S3 CAD prefix; Secrets Manager read for webhook/credential ARNs |
| EventBridge | Polling schedule rules; retention schedule |
| Secrets | Per-connection webhook secret ARNs; rotation with current/next/previous key IDs |
| CloudWatch | Metrics + alarms listed in directive §48; respect quiet hours / operating windows |
| cdk-nag + tests | Required before deploy |

**Do not:** multi-region; production CAD; regenerate `forge-development-secrets-database-app`; weaken FORCE RLS.

---

## 5. Security controls

| Control | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Webhook auth | HMAC-SHA-256; timestamp + nonce + message-id; clock skew; constant-time compare; key rotation grace |
| Replay | Nonce/message-id cache; reject reused |
| Payload logging | Summaries only; never full raw CAD in app logs |
| Secrets | Secrets Manager only; never in `configuration_json` |
| Raw payload API | Separate permission `rms.cad.raw_payload.view_restricted`; high-sensitivity audit |
| Caller data | Separate permission; masked default; retention purge; classification mapping |
| RLS | All CAD tables FORCE RLS; cross-tenant tests required |
| Feature flags | API-enforced; UI gate insufficient |
| Finalized incidents | Store/normalize/timeline/conflict only — no direct field mutation |
| PRODUCTION connections | Cannot enable in Phase 4 development |
| Rate limit / body size / content-type / optional IP allowlist | Enforced on webhook |

---

## 6. Permissions and feature flags

### Feature flags (default **false**)

`rms.cad.enabled`, `rms.cad.webhook.enabled`, `rms.cad.polling.enabled`, `rms.cad.hybrid.enabled`, `rms.cad.operations.enabled`, `rms.cad.raw_payload_access.enabled`, `rms.cad.simulator.enabled`, `platform.cad.adapter_management.enabled`

Enable only on approved synthetic development tenants (start with tenant A).

### Permissions

Seed all directive §40 permissions (`rms.cad.*`, `platform.cad.*`). Creator-only permissions not tenant-grantable. Raw payload not on ordinary tenant admin templates by default.

---

## 7. Test suites required

| Suite | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| Unit | Adapters, normalize, mapping, matching, ownership, out-of-order, cutoff, signature |
| API | All CAD endpoints: authZ, flags, schemas, concurrency |
| RLS | Every CAD table cross-tenant |
| Security | Directive §51 matrix |
| Worker / queue | Idempotency, DLQ, retry, reprocess |
| Playwright | 30 scenarios `@phase4`; tags `@cad`, `@cad-security`, `@cad-hybrid`, `@cad-operations` |
| Mobile / a11y | Viewports + screens in directive §54 |
| Regression | Full Playwright suite (Phase 2 + 3 must remain green) |
| CDK | Synth, nag, queue/IAM unit tests |

No real patient, citizen, caller, or CAD production data.

---

## 8. Documentation deliverables (later increments)

Architecture, API, user guides, testing plan, ADRs (vendor-neutral adapter, immutable raw storage, normalized contract, webhook auth, polling, idempotency, duplicate matching, field ownership, conflicts, finalized behavior, external secrets, retention), compliance evidence under `docs/compliance/soc2/evidence/neris-phase-4/`, status + final acceptance report.

**This plan** is the pre-coding gate. Architecture docs are created alongside increments, not before 4A schema.

---

## 9. Deployment sequence (Phase 4F)

1. Pre-deployment gate (directive §57): SSO, account `511343547817`, region `us-east-1`, Data `UPDATE_COMPLETE`, app secret ARN unchanged, API/RMS 200, ECS healthy, CloudTrail, alarms, lint/typecheck/tests/build/CDK/nag/synth/diff, no secret/Aurora replacement, rollback plan, commit SHA  
2. Messaging / IAM / queue / worker infra (CDK)  
3. Migrations via approved ECS migration task  
4. Compute / API  
5. Worker image (CAD processors)  
6. Creator Console (if changed)  
7. RMS Web + CloudFront invalidation  
8. Feature flags on synthetic tenant only  
9. Simulator setup  
10. Acceptance tests  
11. Post-deploy verification (directive §59)  
12. Final acceptance report — **stop**

Rollback: disable feature flags → disable connections → pause workers / drain queues → revert Compute image → leave migrations forward-compatible (no destructive down required for emergency stop). Do not roll back Data stack secrets.

---

## 10. Estimated cost impact (development)

| Item | Estimate |
| --- | --- |
| Additional SQS queues + DLQs | Low (pennies–few dollars/month at synthetic volume) |
| Extra S3 storage for raw CAD | Low if retention short on synthetic tenants |
| Worker CPU (extra pollers) | Low–moderate if polling interval ≥ 30s and synthetic-only |
| CloudWatch metrics/alarms | Low |
| Secrets Manager (per connection keys) | Low ($0.40/secret/month class) |
| **Avoided** | Multi-region, always-on high-rate polling, separate Aurora, Lambda sprawl |

Exact numbers depend on message volume; track after 4E observability is live.

---

## 11. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| CAD application forks incident model | Force all writes through existing NERIS incident services |
| Silent overwrite of manual fields | Ownership policies + conflicts + tests scenario 23 |
| Finalized mutation | Cutoff + finalized protection + scenario 9/25 |
| Secret replacement via CDK drift | GAP-009 importExistingAppSecret; exclusive deploys; preflight ARN check |
| Alarm noise | Quiet hours + expected operating window |
| Scope creep into Phase 5 | Hard stop after final acceptance report |
| Large synchronous webhook | Persist + enqueue; ACK = accepted for processing |
| Cross-tenant leakage | FORCE RLS + Playwright tenant A/B + API tests |
| Adapter writes incidents | Contract forbids; review gate in 4A |

---

## 12. Rollback strategy

1. Set all `rms.cad.*` overrides to false / remove overrides  
2. Disable all CAD connections (`DISABLED`)  
3. Suspend polling schedules  
4. Stop consuming CAD queues (or scale worker with CAD consumers off)  
5. Redeploy previous Compute/worker images if needed  
6. Leave schema in place (additive migrations); do not drop FORCE RLS  
7. Document incident IDs created during failed window for manual review  

---

## 13. Deferred / out of scope (Phase 4)

- Phase 5, offline sync, external NERIS submission, state submission, ePCR, AI narrative, IRWIN  
- Production CAD vendor onboarding / production customer onboarding  
- Active UI for `NOT_IMPLEMENTED` transports (SFTP, file drop, broker, socket gateway, middleware, manual export)  
- Claiming SOC 2 certified/compliant/audited  

---

## 14. Immediate next step

**PHASE 4A** — after operator acknowledgment of this plan:

1. Scaffold `@forge/cad-contracts` / `@forge/cad-core`  
2. Migration `0013_cad_connections` (+ drizzle schema)  
3. Seed permissions + feature flags  
4. Audit event type constants  
5. Status doc update  

Do not deploy until an increment is verified locally and the pre-deployment gate is satisfied.
