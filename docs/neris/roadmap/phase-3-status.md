# NERIS Phase 3 — Status and Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-07-26 (limitation closeout)  
**Authorization:** Phase 3 development + limitation closeout / full acceptance directive

## Phase summary

| Phase | Name | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1 | Schema Foundation | COMPLETE |
| Phase 2 | Core Incident Shell + MANUAL_ONLY | COMPLETE |
| Phase 3 | Dynamic fire and specialty workflows | ACCEPTED (engineering; human sign-off pending) |

## Phase 3 acceptance

See [phase-3-final-acceptance-report.md](../phase-3-final-acceptance-report.md). Decision: **ACCEPTED**. Phase 4 not started. Product owner sign-off still required.

SOC 2 remains a **readiness program** only. Do not claim certification, compliance, audit completion, Type 1, or Type 2.

## Phase 3 objective

Build schema-driven specialty workflows so users see only relevant sections based on classification, actions, property characteristics, and related signals — without a second incident engine and without dumping all NERIS fields at once.

## Deliverables

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Specialty workflow engine (`@forge/neris`) | DONE | Declarative groups + activation rules |
| Form descriptor wiring (live values) | DONE | Modules map into specialty sections |
| Specialty section API | DONE | `POST …/specialty-sections` |
| Feature flag default **false** | DONE | Override only on approved synthetic FD |
| Dynamic RMS Web nav + banners + N/A | DONE | Classification-driven navigation |
| Section completion indicators | DONE | Percent + required gaps |
| Attachments (presign, quarantine scan, archive) | ACCEPTED | Quarantine-default scanner; full attachment matrix PASS |
| Exposure / casualty / hazmat / system records | ACCEPTED | Scenarios 1–5 Cognito PASS |
| Occupancy/preplan links + proposals | DEPLOYED | Apply requires masterdata.manage |
| Specialty validation | DEPLOYED | Progressive findings in validate runs |
| Specialty permissions + reviewer roles | DEPLOYED | Synthetic admin permissions synced |
| Restricted casualty access | DEPLOYED | Masked lists + access audit |
| Specialty review UI | DEPLOYED | Verified on REVIEW in Cognito Playwright |
| Specialty review APIs | DEPLOYED | Resolve/reopen; section return/approve |
| CI specialty/attachment/a11y tests | DONE | Expanded `neris-incidents-unit-tests` job |
| Playwright Phase 3 + Phase 2 regression | DONE | **34/34 passed** (20 `@phase3`) |
| Ten-scenario Cognito matrix | DONE | Scenarios 1–10 PASS |
| IRWIN transmission | OUT OF SCOPE | Architecture hooks only |
| CAD / external NERIS submit / offline / AI / ePCR | OUT OF SCOPE | Separate authorization required |

## Workflow groups

FIRE, STRUCTURE, WILDLAND, HAZMAT, RESCUE, EXPLOSION, EXPOSURES, CIVILIAN_CASUALTIES, FIRE_SERVICE_CASUALTIES, ALARM_DETECTION, FIRE_PROTECTION, EMERGING_HAZARDS, RISK_REDUCTION, INCIDENT_ANALYSIS.

## Documentation

| Doc | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Specialty workflow architecture | [specialty-workflows.md](../architecture/specialty-workflows.md) |
| Repeatable specialty records | [repeatable-specialty-records.md](../architecture/repeatable-specialty-records.md) |
| Attachments | [attachments.md](../architecture/attachments.md) |
| Casualty access | [casualty-access.md](../security/casualty-access.md) |
| Specialty API | [repeatable-specialty-records.md](../api/repeatable-specialty-records.md) |
| Increment tests | [phase-3-repeatable-record-tests.md](../testing/phase-3-repeatable-record-tests.md) |
| Final acceptance report | [phase-3-final-acceptance-report.md](../phase-3-final-acceptance-report.md) |

## Explicit non-goals (this phase)

- CAD integration
- External NERIS submission
- NERIS offline synchronization
- AI narrative generation
- ePCR development (casualty workflow links architecture only)
- Full IRWIN transmission
- SOC 2 Type 1 or Type 2 work
- Production customer onboarding

## Phase 3 acceptance

**INCOMPLETE** — see [phase-3-final-acceptance-report.md](../phase-3-final-acceptance-report.md). Code and CI for specialty review are in place; deployed 10-scenario matrix, ECS migrate for `0011`/`0012`, and Compute/Frontend deploy verification remain blocked pending explicit deploy approval (GAP-009: do not deploy Data stack).
