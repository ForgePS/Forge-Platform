# Repeatable Specialty Records (Phase 3)

Specialty repeatable records are first-class, tenant-isolated tables linked to a parent incident. They do **not** replace the NERIS field-value store; schema-driven fields continue to use EAV where appropriate. Operational cards (exposures, casualties, hazmat, systems) use dedicated rows for numbering, validation, and security.

## Record families

| Family | Table | Numbering |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exposures | `neris_incident_exposures` | Per-incident sequence (`neris_incident_exposure_sequences`) |
| Civilian casualties | `neris_incident_civilian_casualties` | UUID; masked list views |
| Fire-service casualties | `neris_incident_fire_service_casualties` | UUID; separate permissions |
| Hazmat substances | `neris_incident_hazmat_substances` | UUID |
| Hazmat containers | `neris_incident_hazmat_containers` | UUID; optional substance link |
| Alarm systems | `neris_incident_alarm_systems` | UUID |
| Protection systems | `neris_incident_protection_systems` | UUID |

## Shared behaviors

- Optimistic concurrency (`record_version` / `If-Match`)
- Archive instead of hard delete
- Finalized/voided/archived incidents reject edits
- Specialty feature flag required (`rms.neris.specialty_workflows.enabled`)
- Family-specific permissions
- Audit events on create/archive (casualties also write access audit without restricted payloads)

## API

See [repeatable-specialty-records API](../api/repeatable-specialty-records.md).

## Validation

`SpecialtyValidationService` contributes progressive findings into the shared validation run model (guidance / warning / blocking) with correction paths.
