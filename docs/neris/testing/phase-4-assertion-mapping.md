## Conditional-skip removal confirmation

Removed from `phase-4-cad-acceptance.spec.ts`:
- Early return when no CAD messages for reprocess
- Early return / annotation when no OPEN conflict for KEEP_FORGE
- `test.skip(!hasSecondaryCredentials())` replaced with hard `expect(...).toBe(true)`

Dedicated deterministic specs own their prerequisites:
- `phase-4-keep-forge-conflict.spec.ts`
- `phase-4-reprocess.spec.ts`

Closeout Playwright evidence (2026-07-27): `@phase4` **20 passed**; full chromium **53 passed**.
