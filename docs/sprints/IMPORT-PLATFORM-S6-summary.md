# Import Platform — Sprint S6 Summary

**Date:** 2026-07-29  
**Status:** **READY_FOR_REVIEW**  
**Do not start S7 until S6 is ACCEPTED.**

## Objectives

Shared malware scanning, fail-closed verdict enforcement, quarantine, sensitive-field
classification/masking, protected artifact downloads, audit/log hardening, retention
helpers, and security metrics — without UI, product adapters, or Step Functions activation.

## Completed work

- Migration `0027_import_platform_s6_security.sql` (scan events, security artifacts, file/job security columns, FORCE RLS)
- `@forge/imports`: scanner interface, reference provider, verdict gate, masking, retention, malware queue message, SFN security gate in ASL
- Upload complete enqueues `IMPORT_MALWARE_SCAN` (not format detect first)
- Worker malware processor → CLEAN then format detect; quarantine copy+tags; execute gate
- API: rescan, scan history, results/errors/security-report downloads; execute/approve gates; duplicate/error masking
- OpenAPI `0.6.0-s6`
- Architecture + ops docs

## Design decisions

| Topic | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Scanner | `reference-malware@1` behind `ImportMalwareScanner` (dev/test; replaceable) |
| Overrides | Reserved verdicts only — **no override HTTP endpoint** |
| CLEAN path | Stay `SCANNING` → format detect → `READY_FOR_MAPPING` |
| Quarantine | Copy to `tenants/{tenant}/quarantine/...` + tags; retain original |

## API endpoints added

| Method | Path | Permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/jobs/{id}/files/{fileId}/scan-events` | import.view |
| POST | `/jobs/{id}/files/{fileId}/rescan` | import.validate |
| POST | `/jobs/{id}/results/download` | import.view (+ import.sensitive for privileged) |
| POST | `/jobs/{id}/errors/download` | import.view |
| POST | `/jobs/{id}/security-report/download` | import.view |

## Malware transitions

| From | Action | To |
| --- | --- | --- |
| UPLOADED | malware_start | SCANNING |
| SCANNING | malware_clean | SCANNING (then format detect) |
| SCANNING | detection_pass | READY_FOR_MAPPING |
| SCANNING | malware_quarantine | QUARANTINED |
| SCANNING | malware_fail | SCAN_FAILED |
| SCAN_FAILED / QUARANTINED | rescan_start | SCANNING |

## Step Functions

**DEFINITION_COMPLETE_DEPLOYMENT_PENDING** — ASL includes `SecurityVerdictGate`; not activated.

## Known limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation | Future |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reference scanner only | Not multi-AV / GuardDuty | Interface abstraction; EICAR/key signals for tests | S8+ provider redundancy |
| Product-specific sensitivity metadata | Name-hint + config defaults | Conservative masking; CREDENTIAL never unmasked | Adapters (S7+) |
| Step Functions inactive | Worker path only | API + worker gates | Separate activation |
| Aurora-scale perf | Not load-tested | Unit/perf helpers | S8 |
| Full rollback compensation | Deferred | Classification only | Later sprint |
| UI quarantine/sensitive review | Deferred | API + audit | S7 UI (not authorized) |

Production use: development/security-hardening ready; production scanner provider swap recommended before high-risk tenant enablement.

## Recommendation for S7

Import Center UI / mapping & preview UX only after S6 ACCEPTED. Do not implement product adapters or QR in S6.

## Deployment

**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-07-29, forge-dev / us-east-1)
