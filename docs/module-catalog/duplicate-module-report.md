# Duplicate module report (MODULE-CATALOG-S2)

## Summary

Duplicate **display names** across platforms are expected when implementations differ.
Duplicate **codes** are allowed only within different `product_id` scopes.
Flat Creator catalog UI previously mixed these and showed raw UUIDs.

| NAME | CODES | PRODUCTS | CLASSIFICATION | ACTION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AI Narrative Assistant | AI_NARRATIVE | FORGE_INDUSTRIAL, FORGE_RMS, FORGE_ACADEMY | INTENTIONAL_SHARED_MODULE (product-scoped rows) | Keep one row per product; UI groups by platform |
| Personnel | PERSONNEL | FORGE_INDUSTRIAL, FORGE_RMS | PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_VARIANT | Keep both; never merge |
| Training | TRAINING | FORGE_INDUSTRIAL, FORGE_RMS | PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_VARIANT | Keep both; never merge |
| Documents | DOCUMENTS | FORGE_INDUSTRIAL, FORGE_RMS | PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_VARIANT | Keep both |
| Core | CORE | all four products | PLATFORM_CORE per product | Keep; hide from customer toggles |
| Reports / Reporting | REPORTS vs REPORTING | RMS vs Industrial | PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_VARIANT | Different keys; not duplicates |

## Detailed classifications

### AI Narrative Assistant

- **Type:** INTENTIONAL_SHARED_MODULE (shared *capability*, separate catalog rows)
- **Not:** SAME_MODULE_DUPLICATE
- **Reason:** Each product may entitle AI narrative independently; schema uniqueness is `(product, code)`.
- **API:** Mutations require `productCode` when code is ambiguous.

### Personnel

- **Type:** PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_VARIANT
- **Industrial:** `FORGE_INDUSTRIAL:PERSONNEL` — industrial personnel workspace / API
- **RMS:** `FORGE_RMS:PERSONNEL` — fire-service personnel catalog concept
- **Action:** Do not merge. Creator shows each under its platform tab.

### Training

- **Type:** PLATFORM_SPECIFIC_VARIANT
- Same treatment as Personnel.

### Creator Core / Industrial Core / RMS Core / Academy Core

- **Type:** PLATFORM_CORE (not customer modules)
- Flat catalog previously listed all four as if sellable — **fixed** by hiding PLATFORM_CORE / CREATOR from Module Catalog customer view.

### Tenant Administration

- **Type:** INTERNAL_TOOL on FORGE_CREATOR
- Hidden from customer-assignable catalog.

## Orphans / legacy

| Item | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-S2 Industrial starter subset | LEGACY_RECORD (superseded by full registry seed) | Seed upserts add missing Industrial modules; existing entitlements preserved |
| UUID shown as card disabledReason | MIGRATION_ARTIFACT (UI) | Removed from primary Module Catalog presentation |

## Assignment safety

- No tenant entitlement rows are deleted by catalog canonicalization.
- Expected reconciliation: `OLD_ASSIGNMENT_COUNT == NEW_ASSIGNMENT_COUNT` (difference 0) because module IDs are preserved; only new unused catalog rows are inserted.
