# Platform module map (MODULE-CATALOG-S2)

Authoritative mapping of current Forge catalog modules. Source of truth:
`packages/contracts/src/module-catalog.ts` (+ Industrial registry).

Canonical identity is `(productCode, moduleCode)`. Record IDs are environment-specific
and appear only after seed/migration; this document uses logical keys.

## Reconciliation notes

- Unique constraint remains `(product_id, code)` — duplicate *names* across platforms are intentional platform-specific variants.
- Seed upsert updates metadata without deleting existing `tenant_module_entitlements`.
- Migration `0039_module_catalog_s2.sql` adds catalog columns; seed fills full Industrial registry rows.
