# AI Narrative — Human Review

**Invariant:** No draft becomes record content without an explicit human accept (full or partial).

## Lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| PENDING → VALIDATING → REDACTING → GENERATING → VALIDATING_RESPONSE | Pipeline |
| READY_FOR_REVIEW | Draft available; labeled `AI DRAFT — NOT REVIEWED` |
| ACCEPTED | Human accepted (full or partial) |
| REJECTED | Human rejected with reason |
| FAILED / CANCELLED / EXPIRED | Terminal non-accept paths |

## Review actions

| Action | Route | Permission |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accept all | `POST .../narratives/:requestId/accept` | `ai.narrative.accept` (or product accept) |
| Partial accept | `POST .../narratives/:requestId/partial-accept` | same as accept |
| Reject | `POST .../narratives/:requestId/reject` | `ai.narrative.reject` |
| Regenerate | `POST .../narratives/:requestId/regenerate` | generate or rewrite |
| History | `GET .../narratives/:requestId/history` | `ai.narrative.use` |

Accept body selects draft id, mode (`ACCEPT_ALL` / `PARTIAL`), optional sections, and optional insert-into-record. Reject requires a reason.

## What humans must verify

- Facts match source fields; no invented details.
- Missing-information and conflict warnings from structured output.
- Quality checks (chronological, clear, professional, facts-only) are advisory only.
- Tone and detail level are appropriate for the record type.

## Explicit non-goals

- Auto-finalize of incidents or investigations
- Auto NERIS submission
- Auto ePCR submission
- Silent overwrite of existing narrative without accept

After accept, UI should show `AI-ASSISTED — HUMAN REVIEWED` where the product surfaces draft provenance.
