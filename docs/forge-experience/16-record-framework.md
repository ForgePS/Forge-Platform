# FX Record Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 3)

Everything revolves around a **record**. Forms, reports, dashboards, and My Work are lenses on records — not separate applications.

## Required record attributes

Every record must have:

| Attribute | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Unique Identifier | Stable ID (display may use friendly + mono technical id) |
| Title | Human primary label |
| Status | Workflow / lifecycle status (Status Badge) |
| Owner | Responsible party presentation |
| Created By | Actor |
| Created Date | Timestamp |
| Modified By | Actor |
| Modified Date | Timestamp |
| Priority | Priority Badge when applicable |
| Category | Classification |
| Related Records | Links to other records |
| Attachments | Files / photos |
| Comments | Notes / discussion |
| Timeline | Immutable event stream |
| Audit Trail | Audit-capable history |
| Permissions | Effective access presentation (server authoritative) |
| Record Health | Attention / completeness / blocker signals |

Products map domain fields into this contract. They do not omit core attributes without an FX-approved exception.

## Required record operations

Every record must support (when permitted):

| Operation | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| View | Default workspace |
| Edit | In-place or edit mode; record identity remains visible |
| Archive | Soft end-of-life; recoverable when policy allows |
| Restore | From archive when permitted |
| Duplicate | Creates a new record draft from source |
| Export | Via reporting/export patterns |
| Print | Printable view |
| Share | Share UX that never bypasses permissions |
| Audit | Jump to audit/timeline |
| History | History tab / view |

Unauthorized operations are omitted (prefer omit over disabled tease when existence disclosure is sensitive).

## Example record types (product data, FX shell)

Personnel · Student · Occupancy · Inspection · Incident · Hydrant · Apparatus · Equipment · LOTO Procedure · Permit · and future types.

## Behavior principles

- Open into shared [Workspace Framework](./11-workspace-framework.md)  
- Progressive disclosure: summary first, details on demand  
- Status and priority never color-only  
- Record Health surfaces “what needs attention”  

## Anti-patterns

- Module-specific record pages that ignore workspace layout  
- Forms-as-apps that bury title/status  
- Mutable “history” presented as audit without audit semantics  
- Client-only permission theater
