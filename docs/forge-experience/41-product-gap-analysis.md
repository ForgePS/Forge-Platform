**Document:** `41-product-gap-analysis.md`  
**Phase:** FX-S1  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-30

Maps products against shared FX building blocks. **No production code changed in S1.**

Legend: **Reuse** (consume FX as-is) · **Extend** (domain data/tabs) · **Replace** (remove product fork) · **Debt** (known divergence)
