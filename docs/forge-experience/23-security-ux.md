# FX Security UX Standards

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 4)  
**Author:** Forge Experience Program  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-30

## Purpose

Make security visible without unnecessary friction. Users should always know **why** an action is unavailable.

## Scope

Presentation of security and entitlement states in shell, records, actions, search, and forms. AuthN/Z backends remain platform.

## Goals

- Never silently disable functionality  
- Fail closed with clear next action  
- Do not leak restricted record existence against policy  

## Standard states

| State | Meaning | UX |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Read Only | View allowed; mutate not | Controls read-only; explanation available |
| Restricted | Limited fields/actions | Omitted or masked per policy |
| Locked | Explicit lock | Lock indicator + who/why when permitted |
| Pending Approval | Awaiting decision | Status + approval queue affordances |
| Requires Permission | Missing entitlement | Omitted or disabled **with reason** |
| Expired Session | Session ended | Re-auth interstitial |
| Subscription Expired | Entitlement lapsed | Blocking banner + support path |
| Maintenance Mode | System unavailable | Full-page maintenance |
| Environment Banner | Non-prod / special env | Persistent shell banner |

## Rules

1. Prefer **omit** unauthorized destinations when existence disclosure is sensitive.  
2. If shown disabled, always provide accessible reason text.  
3. Never silently disable.  
4. Security UX does not implement authorization decisions.  

## Best practices

- Pair Requires Permission with Help/Support shortcut when appropriate  
- Environment banners use warning tokens; never subtle  

## Anti-patterns

- Greyed controls with no explanation  
- Client-only unlocks  
- “Contact admin” with no context  

## Future enhancements

- Standardized reason codes catalog  

## Dependencies

- Shell · Empty states · Error handling · Notifications  

## Implementation notes

Presentation contracts only in FX-S0.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Standard states listed  
- [x] No silent disable rule stated
