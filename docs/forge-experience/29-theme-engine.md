# FX Theme Engine

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 4)  
**Author:** Forge Experience Program  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-30

## Purpose

Provide theme variation without forking components.

## Scope

Light, dark, high contrast, agency/tenant branding overlays, and optional future seasonal themes.

## Goals

- Themes override **tokens only**  
- Never override component logic  
- One component implementation across themes  

## Supported themes

| Theme | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Light Theme | Default administrative / daylight |
| Dark Theme | Low-light ops / night |
| High Contrast Theme | Accessibility / bright outdoor glare scenarios |
| Agency Branding | Approved accent/logo token overlays |
| Tenant Branding | Approved tenant accent overlays within FX limits |
| Future Seasonal Themes | Optional; token overlays only |

## Rules

1. Themes map primitives → semantic tokens (`data-fx-theme`, branding attributes).  
2. Components read semantic/component tokens only.  
3. Branding may not reduce contrast below AA.  
4. Products may not ship private theme engines.  

## Responsibilities

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| FX | Theme token sets and switching contract |
| Tenant/Agency | Brand assets within approved slots |
| Platform | Persistence of user/tenant theme preference |

## Examples

- Shell sets `data-fx-theme="dark"`  
- Tenant accent overrides `color.action.primary` via approved extension token  

## Best practices

- Test all themes for status/priority legibility  
- Prefer semantic aliases over one-off brand hex in components  

## Anti-patterns

- `if (theme === 'dark')` branches inside components  
- CSS overrides of component structure per tenant  
- Low-contrast “brand red” that fails AA  

## Future enhancements

- Seasonal theme packs  
- Per-display ops theme presets  

## Dependencies

- `tokens/semantic.*.json` · Brand guidelines · Accessibility  

## Implementation notes

JSON token files are source; CSS variables are projection. No production theme migration in FX-S0.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Theme list defined  
- [x] Tokens-only override rule stated  
- [x] Branding constrained by AA
