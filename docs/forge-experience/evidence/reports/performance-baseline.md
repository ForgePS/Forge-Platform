# Performance Baseline — FX-S1.5

**Document:** `docs/forge-experience/evidence/reports/performance-baseline.md`  
**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Build:** `pnpm --filter @forge/forge-experience-reference build` (Next.js 15.5.21)  
**Status:** BASELINE RECORDED — no optimization work required (no critical issues)

## Bundle size (production build)

| Route | Page size | First Load JS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` (dashboard) | 1.28 kB | 109 kB |
| `/forms` | 1.35 kB | 109 kB |
| `/patterns` | 965 B | 109 kB |
| `/playground` | 1.31 kB | 109 kB |
| `/validation` | 1.48 kB | 109 kB |
| `/workspace` | 1.77 kB | 109 kB |
| Shared JS | — | 102 kB |

Shared chunks: framework ~54 kB + app ~46 kB + other ~2 kB.

## Runtime timings (reference app, local)

Measured via Navigation Timing / Paint Timing on dashboard load (dev session; absolute numbers are environment-sensitive):

| Metric | Value (ms) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `responseEnd` | ~6620 | Local host; cold/dev inflated |
| `domContentLoaded` | ~6720 | Local host |
| `load` | ~7210 | Local host |
| First Contentful Paint | ~6764 | Local host |

**Interpretation:** First Load JS ~109 kB is acceptable for RC1 reference. Production product apps should re-baseline under their CDN and auth shells. No critical FX package issue identified.

## Component / feature notes

| Area | Observation |
| --- | --- |
| Initial render | Static generation; dashboard widgets are client-light SVG |
| Route transitions | App Router client nav; no measured regressions |
| Large table rendering | Reference tables are small; virtual scroll not in RC1 scope |
| Virtual scrolling | Not implemented — tracked as known limitation |
| Dashboard widgets | SVG charts + map render synchronously with synthetic data |
| Bundle size | See table above |

## Issues

| ID | Severity | Description | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P-001 | Info | No virtualized table yet for 1k+ rows | Accepted for RC1 |
| P-002 | Info | Dev-server timing not comparable to CDN prod | Accepted |

No critical performance defects. Optimization deferred.
