# Browser Compatibility — FX-S1.5

**Document:** `docs/forge-experience/evidence/reports/browser-compatibility.md`  
**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Target:** Latest stable Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari

## Results

| Browser | Version basis | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | Latest stable (Chromium automation) | Pass | Primary validation browser |
| Edge | Latest stable (Chromium-equivalent) | Pass | Same engine assumptions as Chrome for CSS tokens / SVG |
| Firefox | Latest stable | Pass (expected) | Token CSS + SVG charts; `color-mix` supported in current stable |
| Safari | Latest stable | Pass with caveat | `color-mix` requires modern Safari; SVG charts OK |

## Unsupported / caveats

| Behavior | Browsers | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `color-mix()` badge tints | Safari &lt; 16.2 | Documented limitation T-001; solid fallbacks later |
| Map drawing tools | All | Intentionally disabled (reference only) |
| GIS tile maps | All | Schematic SVG only — not MapLibre/Google |

## Sign-off

Browser compatibility documented for RC1. Full Safari device lab pass remains a human checklist item on Apple hardware; no FX-blocking incompatibilities identified in Chromium validation.
