# FX Workspace Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 3)

Every record opens into a **shared workspace**.  
Never create completely different layouts for different modules.

## Ownership

- FX owns workspace chrome, tab behavior, and section order patterns  
- Products supply record fields, domain actions, and optional extra tabs  
- Products may **extend** the standard tab list; they may **not** replace standard tab behavior  

## Workspace layout

```text
Workspace Header
        ↓
Record Summary
        ↓
Primary Actions
        ↓
Status Panel
        ↓
Workspace Tabs
        ↓

Audit History

Activity Feed
```

Not every section is visible for every record type. Sections appear when applicable, in this relative order when present. Products do not reorder core chrome arbitrarily.

## Workspace Header

- Record title, type label, environment-safe ID (monospace)  
- Status Badge · Priority Badge  
- Owner / assignee presentation  
- Overflow for secondary record actions  

## Record Summary

- Highest-signal facts for operational scanning  
- Progressive disclosure into Details tab for the rest  

## Primary Actions

- Role-relevant commits (Edit, Assign, Approve, Complete, …)  
- Permission-filtered; danger actions use Confirmation Dialog  

## Status Panel

- Workflow state, blockers, health indicators  
- Answers: what is happening / what needs attention  

## Workspace Tabs

See standardized tabs below. Level-3 navigation only — do not invent deeper nav trees.

## Main Content

- Active tab panel body (Overview, Details, etc.)  
- Forms embed here in service of the record — forms are not a separate app  

## Timeline · Audit · Attachments · Related · Notes · Activity

- Shared FX patterns; product data only  
- Timeline entries immutable (see Timeline Framework)  

## Responsive behavior

| Surface | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop | Header + tabs + optional right context |
| Tablet | Collapsible summary; tabs scroll |
| Phone | Summary → actions → tabs as full-width sections; avoid multi-column |
| Ops display | Larger type; emphasize status + primary actions |

## Anti-patterns

- Module-unique workspace shells  
- Replacing Overview/History semantics per product  
- Hiding audit/timeline for convenience  
- Forms that remove record identity from the header

## Workspace tabs (standard)

Every workspace supports these tabs **when applicable**:

| Tab | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Overview | Operational summary and next actions |
| Details | Full field layout |
| History | Human-readable change history |
| Timeline | Standardized immutable timeline |
| Attachments | Files |
| Photos | Image gallery subset |
| Notes | Notes / comments |
| Related Records | Linked records |
| Tasks | Tasks on this record |
| Approvals | Approval chain / decisions |
| Audit | Audit-oriented view / deep links |
| Documents | Document-centric attachments/versions |
| Settings | Record-level settings when entitled |

**Extension rule:** Products may add tabs (for example Map, LOTO Steps, Roster).  
**Non-negotiable:** Products may not redefine the behavior of the standard tabs above.
