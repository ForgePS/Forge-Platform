# 15 — Final Regression Report (S2F-8)

**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Gate:** FX-S2F-8  
**Method:** Code review + automated FX unit tests + e2e scaffold presence; live manual/UI regression remains a pilot condition  

## Automated results

| Suite | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `src/fx/**/*.test.ts` (13 files) | **66 passed** |
| Module resolvers (`module-flags.test.ts`) | 21 passed |
| Shell/nav flags (`rms-fx-flags.test.ts`) | 6 passed |
| Forms / tables / workspace / dashboard flags + registries | Passed |
| E2E scaffold `fx-s2-regression.scaffold.spec.ts` | Present (flag-matrix smoke; CI defaults flags off) |

## Module regression matrix (code-certified)

| Module | Routes | Feature gate | Presentation switch | APIs (unchanged by inspection) | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Incidents | `/incidents/`, `/incidents/new/`, `/incidents/[id]/` | `incidentShell` / `manualIntake` | module ∧ tables/forms/workspace | Incident list/create/workspace clients | Pass (code) |
| Incident Review | `/review/`, incident `?section=REVIEW` | `officerReview` | module ∧ tables/forms | Review queue + officer review clients | Pass (code) |
| CAD Messages | `/cad/messages/` | `cadOperations` | module ∧ tables | `listCadMessages` | Pass (code) |
| CAD Connections | `/cad/connections/` | `cadEnabled` | module ∧ forms/tables | list/create/enable/disable/test | Pass (code) |
| CAD Conflicts | `/cad/conflicts/` | `cadEnabled` | module ∧ tables | list OPEN + resolve | Pass (code) |
| NERIS Configuration | `/configuration/` | `tenantConfiguration` | module ∧ forms | get/put configuration + overlays | Pass (code) |
| Administration | `/select-tenant/` | Session auth | module ∧ tables | `chooseTenant` | Pass (code) |
| Utilities | `/health/` | None | module alone | `GET /health` | Pass (code) |

## Foundations

| Foundation | Wired | Default off | Fail-safe | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Shell | Yes | Yes | Legacy shell | Pass (code) |
| Navigation | Yes (requires shell) | Yes | Invalid nav-without-shell → legacy | Pass (unit) |
| Workspace | Yes | Yes | Legacy incident chrome | Pass (code) |
| Forms | Yes | Yes | Legacy forms | Pass (code) |
| Tables | Yes | Yes | Legacy tables | Pass (code) |
| Dashboard | Yes (S2C; ambient) | Yes | Legacy home | Pass (code) |

## Failures / defects found in S2F-8

| Sev | Count | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | 0 | None discovered |
| P1 (migration) | 0 | None discovered |
| P3 | Open | Sanitized screenshots / full manual UI matrix pending across modules |

## Not fully exercised in this phase

- Live browser regression on authenticated multi-tenant data  
- Destructive CAD resolve / connection enable actions against non-prod tenants  
- Full Playwright execution with all flag combinations enabled  

These remain **pilot entry conditions**, not unresolved migration P1s from code inspection.
