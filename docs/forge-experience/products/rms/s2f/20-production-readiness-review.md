# 20 — Production Readiness Review (S2F-8)

**Date:** 2026-07-31  

## Scores

| Dimension | Risk | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stability (default OFF) | **Low** | Production remains legacy until flags enabled |
| Regression risk on enable | **Medium** | Presentation switch only; pilot should enable one module at a time |
| Accessibility | **Medium** | Patterns sound; formal AA audit pending |
| Performance | **Low–Medium** | No measured regressions; measure in pilot |
| Rollback | **Low** | Independent module flags + legacy retained |
| Documentation | **Low** | Module packages 00–09 + S2F-8 closeout present |
| Evidence completeness | **Medium** | Screenshots / manual matrices pending |
| Remaining risks | **Low–Medium** | See risk register; S2F-4 connection validation conditions |

## Mitigations

1. Keep all FX flags default OFF in production.  
2. Pilot: enable one module at a time with foundations as required.  
3. Complete S2F-4 connection validation conditions before enabling CAD Connections for pilot tenants.  
4. Attach sanitized screenshots and a11y/responsive checklists before GA.  
5. Do not remove compatibility / legacy paths in this program.
