# FX-S2F-7 Completion Report — Administration & Utilities

**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Product:** Forge RMS  
**Module flags:** `fx.rms.module.administration.enabled`, `fx.rms.module.utilities.enabled` (default **false**)  
**Foundation dependencies:** tables for select-tenant FX; utilities health needs no foundation  
**Gate:** FX-S2F-7 (final functional S2F migration)  

## Decision requested

```text
APPROVE S2F COMPLETION
```

Alternates: `APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS` · `RETURN FOR CORRECTION`

### Suggested conditions

1. Capture sanitized desktop/tablet screenshots before tenant enablement.  
2. Keep both module flags default-off.  
3. Confirm `/login/` remains legacy (auth out of scope).  
4. Do not begin Stabilization, Legacy Retirement, Pilot, or GA until formally authorized.

## Executive summary

S2F-7 migrates verified RMS Administration (`/select-tenant/`) and Utilities (`/health/`) presentation behind independent module flags. Select-tenant requires module ∧ tables; health uses utilities module alone. `chooseTenant` and `/health` fetch behavior are unchanged. Login and auth callback are deferred/N/A per authentication out-of-scope. No user/role/org/feature-admin UIs exist in rms-web — documented N/A. Creator Console not absorbed.

## Verified scope

| Route | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `/select-tenant/` | Migrated (administration ∧ tables) |
| `/health/` | Migrated (utilities) |

## Deferred / N/A

| Item | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `/login/` | Deferred — authentication |
| `/auth/callback/` | N/A |
| User/role/RBAC/org/feature admin UIs | N/A — absent |
| CAD unmapped / mappings | Deferred — CAD ops, not this module |
| Stabilization / legacy retirement / pilot / GA | Not authorized |

## Feature-flag behavior

| Combo | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Administration off | Legacy select-tenant |
| Administration on + tables off | Legacy compat |
| Administration on + tables on | FX select-tenant |
| Utilities off | Legacy health |
| Utilities on | FX health panel |
| Flags independent | Yes |

## Component inventory

See `04-component-map.md`.

## Forms / tables / dialogs

| Surface | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Forms | None on verified admin/utilities routes |
| Tables | Select-tenant columns + Select action preserved |
| Dialogs | None on verified routes |

## Permissions / feature gates

No product FeatureGate on these routes; session auth + existing `chooseTenant` remain authoritative. FX flags do not grant rights.

## API & payload parity

Same `chooseTenant` client path; same `GET /health` via `apiFetchRaw`. No API/schema changes.

## Tenant isolation

Tenant list remains `me.tenants` from session; selection still uses web-kit `chooseTenant`. No cross-tenant UI invented.

## Accessibility / responsive / theme

FX table caption + section boundary on select-tenant; FxPanel + status badge on health when FX active.

## Performance

Same fetch patterns; no new polling.

## Mixed-mode / rollback

Resolver unit tests + e2e scaffold; independent module rollback verified by design.

## Automated tests

`resolveAdministrationModulePresentation` / `resolveUtilitiesModulePresentation` in `module-flags.test.ts`; e2e scaffold entries.

## Defects

| Sev | Count |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | 0 |
| P1 | 0 |
| P3 | Screenshots pending; login deferred by design |

## Risks

| ID | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| R-S2F-015 | Login left legacy — intentional auth boundary |
| R-S2F-016 | Planning “admin” broader than live RMS — migrated verified only |
| R-S2F-017 | Health FX needs no foundation — documented exception |

## Evidence index

`08-evidence.md` · `s2f/14-evidence-index.md`

## Production changes

| Area | Changed? |
| --- | --- |
| Default UX | **No** (flags off) |
| Auth / RBAC / tenant resolution / APIs | **No** |
| Code behind flags | Yes |

## Recommendation

**APPROVE S2F COMPLETION** after conditions — then authorize Stabilization (S2F-8) separately if desired.

---

**STOP:** Stabilization, Legacy Retirement, Pilot, and General Availability not started.
