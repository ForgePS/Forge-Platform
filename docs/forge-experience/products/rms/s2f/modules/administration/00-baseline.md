# S2F-7 Administration & Utilities — Baseline

**Module:** Administration & Utilities  
**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Source:** Verified `apps/rms-web` (not planning docs alone)

## Verified routes migrated

| Route | Classification | Flag | Presentation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/select-tenant/` | Administration | `fx.rms.module.administration.enabled` | Tenant list + Select action |
| `/health/` | Utilities | `fx.rms.module.utilities.enabled` | Platform health probe display |

## `/select-tenant/` verified behavior

| Concern | Live behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Auth source | `useAuth()` → `me.tenants`, `chooseTenant(tenantId)` |
| Columns | Display name, Slug, Status (`tenantStatus`), Current, Action |
| Select | `chooseTenant` then `router.push("/")` |
| Disabled | `!tenant.selectable` or busy selecting |
| Unauthenticated | Link to `/login/` |
| Feature gate | None (session utility) |

## `/health/` verified behavior

| Concern | Live behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Fetch | `apiFetchRaw("/health")` |
| Fields | `status`, `service`, `environment`, `version`, `timestamp` |
| Loading | `"Checking API health…"` |
| Feature gate | None (ops probe) |

## Explicitly NOT migrated (auth / out of scope)

| Route | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| `/login/` | **Deferred** — authentication presentation; auth explicitly out of S2F-7 scope |
| `/auth/callback/` | **N/A** — OAuth callback; not an admin UI surface |

## Explicitly NOT present in live RMS (N/A)

| Capability | Status |
| --- | --- |
| User / role / RBAC administration UI | Absent in rms-web |
| Organization settings admin | Absent |
| Feature entitlement management UI | Absent |
| Integrations admin | Absent |
| Import / export tools | Absent |
| Audit viewer | Absent |
| Maintenance / scheduled jobs UI | Absent |
| Creator Console / Tenant Admin | Not absorbed into RMS (charter) |

## Related but not S2F-7

| Route | Why deferred |
| --- | --- |
| `/cad/unmapped/` | CAD operational queue; not Admin/Utilities |
| `/cad/mappings/` | CAD operational queue; not Admin/Utilities |
| `/configuration/` | S2F-6 NERIS Configuration |
