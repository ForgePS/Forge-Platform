# FX-S2F-6 Completion Report — NERIS Configuration

**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Product:** Forge RMS  
**Module flag:** `fx.rms.module.nerisConfiguration.enabled` (default **false**)  
**Foundation dependencies:** `fx.rms.forms.enabled`  
**Gate:** FX-S2F-6  

## Decision requested

```text
APPROVE NEXT S2F MODULE
```

Alternates: `APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS` · `RETURN FOR CORRECTION`

### Suggested conditions

1. Capture sanitized desktop/tablet screenshots before tenant enablement.  
2. Keep module flag default-off.  
3. Manually verify operating-mode and field-overlay save payloads on a non-prod tenant.  
4. Do not begin S2F-7 Administration / Utilities until this checkpoint is accepted.

## Executive summary

NERIS Configuration at `/configuration/` is composed behind `fx.rms.module.nerisConfiguration.enabled` ∧ forms. Verified live scope is operating-mode save + field-overlay customize (label, help, order, favorite). APIs, payloads, FeatureGate `tenantConfiguration`, and official-code read-only posture are unchanged. Planning items (agency ids, export config, code mapping editors, defaults, cancel/reset, import/export, audit) are absent — documented N/A. Legacy forms preserved.

## Verified scope

Migrated: `/configuration/` operating mode panel + field overlays form only.

## Routes migrated

| Route | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `/configuration/` | Yes |

## Deferred / N/A items

| Capability | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Organization / agency identifiers | N/A — not in live UI |
| Export / transmission configuration | N/A |
| Official code mapping editor | N/A — read-only by design |
| Incident/response/personnel/apparatus defaults | N/A |
| Validation-rule editor | N/A |
| Cancel / reset / import / export / audit | N/A |
| Administration / Utilities | S2F-7 (not authorized) |

## Feature-flag behavior

| Combo | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Module off | Legacy forms |
| Module on + forms off | Legacy compat |
| Module on + forms on | FX forms |
| Forms on + module off | Legacy |

## Component inventory

See `04-component-map.md`.

## Form / validation / API parity

Same GET/PUT clients; operating-mode payload hard-codes `MANUAL_ONLY` + existing status; overlay payload fields unchanged. No client validation rule changes.

## Permission validation

`FeatureGate` `tenantConfiguration` unchanged.

## Tenant-isolation validation

Tenant-scoped APIs unchanged; no cross-tenant UI added.

## Accessibility / responsive / theme

FX form labels/sections/action bars when active; foundation responsive form layout; token-driven chrome.

## Performance results

Same dual-fetch load pattern; no new polling. Flag resolver overhead negligible (unit-covered).

## Mixed-mode validation

Resolver unit tests cover module/forms matrix; e2e scaffold added.

## Rollback results

Module off → legacy; other modules unaffected.

## Automated tests

`resolveNerisConfigurationModulePresentation` cases in `module-flags.test.ts`; e2e scaffold matrix.

## Defects

| Sev | Count |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | 0 |
| P1 | 0 |
| P3 | Screenshots pending |

## Risks

| ID | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| R-S2F-013 | Planning docs imply broader NERIS settings than live UI — migrated verified scope only |
| R-S2F-014 | Operating mode save always posts `MANUAL_ONLY` — preserved legacy behavior |

## Evidence index

`08-evidence.md` · `s2f/14-evidence-index.md`

## Production changes

| Area | Changed? |
| --- | --- |
| Default UX | **No** (flag off) |
| NERIS export / mapping / validation / APIs | **No** |
| Code behind flag | Yes |

## Recommendation

**APPROVE NEXT S2F MODULE** (S2F-7 Administration / Utilities) after conditions.

---

**STOP:** Administration, Utilities, Stabilization, Legacy Retirement, Pilot, and GA not started.
