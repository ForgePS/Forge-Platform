# FX-S2F-3 Completion Report — CAD Messages & Activity

**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Product:** Forge RMS  
**Module flag:** `fx.rms.module.cadMessages.enabled` (default **false**)  
**Foundation dependencies:** `fx.rms.tables.enabled`  
**Gate:** FX-S2F-3  

## Decision requested

```text
APPROVE NEXT S2F MODULE
```

Alternates: `APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS` · `RETURN FOR CORRECTION`

### Suggested conditions

1. Capture sanitized desktop/tablet screenshots before tenant enablement.  
2. Keep module flag default-off.  
3. Do not treat `/cad/operations/` as in-scope until separately authorized.  
4. Do not begin S2F-4 CAD Connections until this checkpoint is accepted.

## Executive summary

CAD message **metadata** list at `/cad/messages/` is composed behind `fx.rms.module.cadMessages.enabled` ∧ tables. Live app has no activity feed, detail drawer, retry, search, or raw payload UI — those planning items are deferred/N/A. APIs, permissions, status strings, and tenant scoping unchanged. Legacy table preserved.

## Verified scope

Migrated: `/cad/messages/` metadata table only.

## Routes migrated

| Route | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `/cad/messages/` | Yes |

## Routes deferred

| Route / capability | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Activity feed | Not present in rms-web |
| `/cad/operations/` | Separate operations summary |
| Message detail / retry / search | Not present |
| Connections / Conflicts | Later S2F phases |

## Feature-flag behavior

| Combo | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Module off | Legacy |
| Module on + tables off | Legacy compat |
| Module on + tables on | FX table |
| Tables on + module off | Legacy |

## Component inventory

See `04-component-map.md`.

## Legacy compatibility components

Legacy HTML table retained for rollback / module-off.

## Table / search / filter / sort / pagination parity

Columns and full-list load preserved. No search/filter/sort/pagination existed — none added.

## Message-status parity

`processingStatus` and `authenticationStatus` displayed as exact API values.

## Incident-link parity

`sourceIncidentId` remains plain text (no new hyperlink invented).

## Retry or reprocessing parity

N/A — not in live UI.

## API and payload parity

Same `listCadMessages` GET; no mutations.

## Permission validation

`FeatureGate` `cadOperations` unchanged.

## Tenant-isolation validation

Tenant-scoped API unchanged; no cross-tenant UI added.

## Accessibility / responsive / theme

FX table caption + section boundary when FX active; foundation responsive overflow; token-driven chrome.

## Performance results

No new fetch pattern; full list as legacy. Flag resolver overhead negligible (unit-covered).

## Mixed-mode validation

Resolver unit tests cover module/tables matrix; e2e scaffold added.

## Rollback results

Module off → legacy; other modules unaffected.

## Automated tests

`resolveCadMessagesModulePresentation` cases in `module-flags.test.ts`; e2e scaffold matrix.

## Defects

| Sev | Count |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | 0 |
| P1 | 0 |
| P3 | Screenshots pending; “Activity” planning name vs live list discrepancy documented |

## Risks

| ID | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| R-S2F-007 | No activity feed — planning/live gap accepted |
| R-S2F-008 | Operations page not under cadMessages flag — deferred |

## Evidence index

`08-evidence.md` · `s2f/14-evidence-index.md`

## Production changes

| Area | Changed? |
| --- | --- |
| Default UX | **No** (flag off) |
| CAD ingest / APIs / permissions | **No** |
| Code behind flag | Yes |

## Recommendation

**APPROVE NEXT S2F MODULE** (S2F-4 CAD Connections) after conditions.

---

**STOP:** CAD Connections, Conflicts, NERIS Configuration, Administration, Utilities not started.
