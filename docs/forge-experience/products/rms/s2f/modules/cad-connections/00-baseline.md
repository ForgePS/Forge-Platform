# S2F-4 CAD Connections — Baseline

**Module:** CAD Connections  
**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Source:** Verified `apps/rms-web` (not planning docs alone)

## Live route migrated

| Route | Entry | Gate | APIs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/cad/connections/` | `app/cad/connections/page.tsx` | `cadEnabled` | `listCadConnections`, `createCadConnection`, `enableCadConnection`, `disableCadConnection`, `testCadConnection` |

## Verified create behavior

| Concern | Live behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Form field | Name only (default `"Synthetic CAD"`) |
| Fixed payload | `vendor: Forge`, `adapterKey: forge.synthetic`, `adapterVersion: 1.0.0`, `environment: DEVELOPMENT`, `transportType: HTTPS_WEBHOOK`, `intakeMode: HYBRID`, `configurationJson: {}` |
| Success copy | `"Connection created as DRAFT."` |

## Verified list columns

| Column | Field |
| --- | --- |
| Name | `name` |
| Public ID | `publicId` (mono) |
| Status | `status` (exact API string) |
| Health | `healthStatus` (exact API string) |
| Actions | Test / Enable / Disable |

## Verified row actions

| Action | API |
| --- | --- |
| Test | `POST …/cad/connections/{id}/test` → message `Test result: ${status}` |
| Enable | `POST …/cad/connections/{id}/enable` |
| Disable | `POST …/cad/connections/{id}/disable` |

## Explicitly NOT present in live UI

| Capability | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Edit connection form | Absent |
| Archive / delete controls | Absent |
| Credential / webhook secret display | Explicitly excluded in copy; secrets never shown |
| PRODUCTION environment create | Copy states PRODUCTION stays disabled; create hard-codes DEVELOPMENT |
| Search / filters / sort / pagination | Absent (full list load) |
| Detail drawer / `/cad/connections/{id}` | Absent |

## Related but out of S2F-4 scope

| Route | Why deferred |
| --- | --- |
| `/cad/messages/` | S2F-3 (separate module) |
| `/cad/conflicts/` | S2F-5 |
| `/cad/operations/` | Separate operations summary |
| `/cad/unmapped/`, `/cad/mappings/` | Not this module |

## Secret / credential posture

UI never renders secret values. API type exposes `hasCredentialsSecret` / `hasWebhookSecret` booleans only; page does not display those fields either. No change to secrets storage or credential handling.
