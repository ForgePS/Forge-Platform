# FX-S2F-4 Completion Report — CAD Connections

**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Product:** Forge RMS  
**Module flag:** `fx.rms.module.cadConnections.enabled` (default **false**)  
**Foundation dependencies:** `fx.rms.forms.enabled`, `fx.rms.tables.enabled`  
**Gate:** FX-S2F-4  

## Decision requested

```text
APPROVE NEXT S2F MODULE
```

Alternates: `APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS` · `RETURN FOR CORRECTION`

### Suggested conditions

1. Capture sanitized desktop/tablet screenshots before tenant enablement.  
2. Keep module flag default-off.  
3. Confirm secrets remain unddisplayed in FX and legacy modes.  
4. Do not begin S2F-5 CAD Conflicts until this checkpoint is accepted.

## Executive summary

CAD Connections at `/cad/connections/` is composed behind `fx.rms.module.cadConnections.enabled` ∧ forms (create) ∧ tables (list). Create payload, list columns, test/enable/disable actions, FeatureGate `cadEnabled`, secret redaction posture, and tenant-scoped APIs are unchanged. Legacy form and table preserved for independent rollback. No archive/delete/edit UI existed — none invented.

## Verified scope

Migrated: `/cad/connections/` create form + connections table only.

## Routes migrated

| Route | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `/cad/connections/` | Yes |

## Routes deferred

| Route / capability | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Edit / archive / delete UI | Not present in live rms-web |
| `/cad/conflicts/` | S2F-5 |
| `/cad/messages/` | Separate module (S2F-3) |
| `/cad/operations/` | Separate operations summary |
| Credential / secrets management UI | Explicitly out of presentation scope |

## Feature-flag behavior

| Combo | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Module off | Legacy form + legacy table |
| Module on + forms off + tables off | Legacy compat both |
| Module on + forms on + tables off | FX form + legacy table |
| Module on + forms off + tables on | Legacy form + FX table |
| Module on + forms + tables | FX form + FX table |
| Forms/tables on + module off | Legacy (module gates) |

## Component inventory

See `04-component-map.md`.

## Legacy compatibility components

Legacy HTML form and table retained for rollback / module-off.

## Create / list / action parity

| Concern | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Create name field + fixed synthetic payload | Pass |
| List columns | Pass |
| Test / Enable / Disable | Pass |
| Status / health exact API strings | Pass |
| Secrets never displayed | Pass |

## Archive or delete parity

N/A — not in live UI.

## API and payload parity

Same list/create/enable/disable/test clients; no payload field changes.

## Permission validation

`FeatureGate` `cadEnabled` unchanged.

## Tenant-isolation validation

Tenant-scoped APIs unchanged; no cross-tenant UI added.

## Accessibility / responsive / theme

FX form + table chrome when active; foundation responsive overflow; token-driven chrome.

## Performance results

No new fetch pattern; full list as legacy. Flag resolver overhead negligible (unit-covered).

## Mixed-mode validation

Resolver unit tests cover module/forms/tables matrix; e2e scaffold added.

## Rollback results

Module off → legacy; other modules unaffected.

## Automated tests

`resolveCadConnectionsModulePresentation` cases in `module-flags.test.ts`; e2e scaffold matrix.

## Defects

| Sev | Count |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | 0 |
| P1 | 0 |
| P3 | Screenshots pending |

## Risks

| ID | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| R-S2F-009 | S2E foundation-only FX path replaced by module∧foundation — intentional strangler; foundations alone no longer FX this page |
| R-S2F-010 | No archive/delete/edit in live UI — accepted N/A |

## Evidence index

`08-evidence.md` · `s2f/14-evidence-index.md`

## Production changes

| Area | Changed? |
| --- | --- |
| Default UX | **No** (flag off) |
| CAD ingest / APIs / secrets / permissions | **No** |
| Code behind flag | Yes |

## Recommendation

**APPROVE NEXT S2F MODULE** (S2F-5 CAD Conflicts) after conditions.

---

**STOP:** CAD Conflicts, NERIS Configuration, Administration, Utilities, pilot rollout, and legacy retirement not started.
