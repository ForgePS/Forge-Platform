# S2F-5 CAD Conflicts — Baseline

**Module:** CAD Conflicts  
**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Source:** Verified `apps/rms-web` (not planning docs alone)

## Live route migrated

| Route | Entry | Gate | APIs |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/cad/conflicts/` | `app/cad/conflicts/page.tsx` | `cadEnabled` | `listCadConflicts`, `resolveCadConflict` |

## Verified list behavior

| Concern | Live behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Query | Hard-coded `{ status: "OPEN" }` — no filter UI |
| Columns | Type (`conflictType`), Severity, Field (`fieldIdentifier`), Incident, Actions |
| Incident link | `/incidents/{incidentId}/` with truncated id label when present |
| Empty copy | `"No open conflicts."` |

## Verified resolution actions

| Button | `resolutionAction` | Reason template |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Keep Forge | `KEEP_FORGE` | `Resolved from CAD conflicts UI as KEEP_FORGE` |
| Use CAD | `USE_CAD` | `Resolved from CAD conflicts UI as USE_CAD` |
| Escalate | `ESCALATE` | `Resolved from CAD conflicts UI as ESCALATE` |

Payload also sends `recordVersion` from the row. After resolve, list reloads.

## Explicitly NOT present in live UI

| Capability | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Conflict detail route / drawer | Absent |
| Search / filter / sort / pagination UI | Absent (OPEN-only full list) |
| Status column display | `status` on type but not shown (list is OPEN-only) |
| Closed / historical conflicts view | Absent |
| Auto-resolution controls | Absent |
| Create incident from conflict | Absent |

## Related but out of S2F-5 scope

| Route | Why deferred |
| --- | --- |
| `/cad/operations/` | Separate operations summary |
| `/cad/messages/` | S2F-3 |
| `/cad/connections/` | S2F-4 |
| `/cad/unmapped/`, `/cad/mappings/` | Not this module |
| Conflict detection / matching backends | Explicitly not authorized |
