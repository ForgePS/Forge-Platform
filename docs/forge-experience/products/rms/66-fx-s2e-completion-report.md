# FX-S2E Completion Report — Shared Forms & Data Tables

**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Product:** Forge RMS  
**Reference standard:** Forge Experience Design System v1.0.0-RC1  
**Gate:** FX-S2E  

## Decision requested

```text
APPROVE FX-S2F
```

Alternates: `APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS` · `RETURN FOR CORRECTION`

### Suggested conditions

1. Capture screenshots in `evidence/s2e/screenshots/` before tenant enablement.  
2. Keep `fx.rms.forms.enabled` and `fx.rms.tables.enabled` default-off until non-prod validation.  
3. Schedule a follow-on pass for `FieldRenderer` chrome (incident section fields) under a separate authorization if desired.  
4. Promote mature RMS FX field/table wrappers into `@forge/fx-ui` via component governance after pilot.

## Summary

Shared forms and tables presentation frameworks implemented under `apps/rms-web/src/fx/forms/` and `apps/rms-web/src/fx/tables/`. Existing RMS surfaces migrated behind independent default-off flags. Validation rules, APIs, permissions, NERIS, CAD logic, and workflows unchanged.

## Form inventory

| ID | Migrated |
| --- | --- |
| `rms-new-incident` | Yes |
| `rms-cad-connection-create` | Yes |
| Incident FieldRenderer sections | Deferred (legacy markup) |
| Officer/specialty review forms | Deferred (legacy markup) |

## Table inventory

| ID | Migrated |
| --- | --- |
| `rms-incidents-list` | Yes |
| `rms-review-queue` | Yes |
| `rms-cad-messages` | Yes |
| `rms-cad-connections` | Yes |

## Accessibility

Form and table a11y notes in `57` / `58`. WCAG 2.2 AA target; manual evidence pending pilot screenshots.

## Responsive validation

Documented in `59-responsive-validation.md`.

## Performance

Error isolation + optional virtual windowing — `60-performance.md`.

## Rollback

Flags off → legacy presentation. Routes/session/drafts preserved — `64-rollback.md`.

## Defects

| Severity | Count |
| --- | --- |
| P0 | 0 |
| P1 | 0 |
| P3 | Screenshot package pending; FieldRenderer not yet on FX chrome |

## Risks

| ID | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| R-S2-017 | FieldRenderer still legacy — accepted deferral |
| R-S2-018 | Incidents list sort UI still not sent to API (parity with legacy) — accepted |

## Evidence

`65-evidence.md` + `evidence/s2e/`.

## Production changes

| Area | Changed? |
| --- | --- |
| Default UX | **No** (flags off) |
| APIs / DB / auth / NERIS / CAD / permissions / validation rules | **No** |
| Seed flag definitions | Yes — both default false |
| Code behind flags | Yes |

## Component registry

Updated platform `docs/forge-experience/44-component-registry.md` with S2E RMS presentation wrappers (promotion candidates).

## Recommended next step

After approval: **FX-S2F** (per program sequence — typically search/notifications/mobile polish or next authorized gate). Do not start until formal approval.
