# 30 — Dashboard Performance

**Date:** 2026-07-30

| Requirement | Approach |
| --- | --- |
| Avoid blocking page render | Flag resolves → legacy or dashboard; widgets load data independently |
| Isolate failures | `WidgetErrorBoundary` per widget |
| Lazy / progressive | Suspense + per-widget fetch; no page-wide spinner for all widgets |
| No polling | Manual refresh only |
| Shell responsiveness | Dashboard does not alter shell flags |

One failed widget cannot crash the page.
