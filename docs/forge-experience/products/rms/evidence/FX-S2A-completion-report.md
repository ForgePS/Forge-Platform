# FX-S2A Completion Report — Forge RMS Inventory & Compatibility

**Date:** 2026-07-30  
**Product:** Forge RMS (`apps/rms-web`)  
**Standard:** Forge Experience Design System `v1.0.0-RC1`  
**Gate:** FX-S2A — Inventory and Compatibility  

---

## Decision requested

```text
APPROVE FX-S2B
```

Alternate options for reviewers: `APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS` · `RETURN FOR CORRECTION`

**Recommended:** **APPROVE FX-S2B** with conditions below.

### Suggested conditions

1. Resolve or explicitly defer **DEC-S2-005** (Config Studio nav vs hardcoded) before coding nav adapter.  
2. Confirm **DEC-S2-004** posture: Incident may be first FX workspace **or** Personnel waits for UI — document choice before S2D.  
3. Do not seed `fx.rms.*` flags default-on.  
4. No NERIS/CAD/auth behavior changes in S2B.

## Summary counts

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Routes inventoried | **16** (100% of `rms-web` pages) |
| Screens inventoried | **16** top-level + **22** incident sections |
| Local components inventoried | **14** + 2 hooks + 2 CSS modules |
| Classification totals | Extension **12** · Temp compatibility **5** · Legacy CSS **2** · Unknown **0** |
| Shared FX reuse candidates | Shell, buttons/alerts, workspace, table adapter, dialogs, dashboard widgets |
| RMS-specific extensions | Incident/CAD/NERIS/AI/specialty/attachments/field-renderer |
| Temporary compatibility components | AppShell, FeatureGate chrome, EnvironmentBanner bridge, searchable-select, ListControlsView |
| Unknown components | **0** |
| Permission gaps | Prevention/catalog modules without UI; soft-auth pages need careful S2B handling |
| Feature-flag plan | Designed (`18`) — existing product flags unchanged; FX flags default-off |
| High-risk workflows | Incident lifecycle, NERIS config, CAD conflict apply, attachments isolation, AI narrative |
| Regression coverage | Existing Playwright suite mapped; FX scaffold spec added (skipped) |
| Open defects (migration) | None P0; inventory notes P2/Info only |
| Risks | See `22-risk-register.md` |
| Visible production changes in S2A | **None** |

| Compatibility adapters (design) | ✓ `evidence/plans/compatibility-adapters.md` |
| Risk register | ✓ |
| Regression scaffolding | ✓ e2e scaffold + plan |
| Evidence index | ✓ |

## High-risk workflows identified

1. Incident create → edit → specialty → review → approve/return/finalize/void  
2. NERIS tenant configuration manage  
3. CAD ingest → conflicts → apply / keep Forge  
4. Attachments upload/archive + cross-tenant isolation  
5. AI narrative rewrite/quality under stacked flags  

## Material baseline finding

`rms-web` today is **NERIS + CAD**, not the full multi-module fire RMS described in long-range adoption docs. Personnel/prevention/fleet/etc. are **catalog/legacy gaps**, not missing inventory rows inside the current app. FX-S2B should proceed against the **live** surface area without inventing routes.

## Open items (non-blocking for S2A)

| ID | Item | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DEC-S2-004 | First FX workspace choice | Product owner |
| DEC-S2-005 | Nav source of truth | Product owner |
| R-S2-007 | Mobile nav disclosure in FX shell | FX + RMS S2B |
| T-001 (RC1) | Safari color-mix fallbacks before GA | FX |

---

## Recommended next step

After approval: begin **FX-S2B — Application Shell and Navigation** behind `fx.rms.shell.enabled` / `fx.rms.navigation.enabled` (default off), implementing adapters designed in S2A, with rollback tested before any tenant enablement.

**Do not begin S2B until this report is formally approved.**
