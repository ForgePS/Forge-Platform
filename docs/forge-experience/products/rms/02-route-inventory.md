**Total routes accounted for:** 16/16 filesystem pages.

## Pseudo-routes (query sections)

Incident workspace deep links: `/incidents/[id]/?section=<KEY>`

Keys (22): `OVERVIEW`, `DISPATCH`, `LOCATION`, `UNITS_PERSONNEL`, `CLASSIFICATION`, `FIRE`, `STRUCTURE`, `WILDLAND`, `HAZMAT`, `RESCUE`, `EXPLOSION`, `EXPOSURES`, `CIVILIAN_CASUALTIES`, `FIRE_SERVICE_CASUALTIES`, `ALARM_DETECTION`, `FIRE_PROTECTION`, `EMERGING_HAZARDS`, `RISK_REDUCTION`, `INCIDENT_ANALYSIS`, `NARRATIVE`, `ATTACHMENTS`, `REVIEW`

Preserve all deep links during shell/workspace migration.

## Layouts

| Path | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `app/layout.tsx` | `ApiBootstrap` + `AppShell` wraps all |
| `app/incidents/layout.tsx` | Redirect unauthenticated → `/login/` |

## Middleware

None. Do not add auth middleware that changes auth behavior without separate authorization.

## Not in inventory (no page files)

Personnel, training, scheduling, daily log, fleet, prevention/*, hydrants, preplans, documents, reports, employee portal, NERIS submission status console beyond configuration/incident flow, global search route, notifications route, My Work route.

## Gaps / P0 inventory

| ID | Severity | Finding | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| INV-R-001 | P2 | Soft-auth pages rely on FeatureGate/UX rather than layout RequireAuth | Document; do not weaken; S2B must preserve permission UX |
| INV-R-002 | Info | Config Studio nav unused | Compatibility note for S2B |

**Unresolved P0 inventory gaps:** none for existing routes.
