# 04 — Production Validation

**Phase:** FX-P1  
**Status:** **NOT STARTED** — blocked on pilot tenant designation  

## Wave 0 (pre-enablement)

| Check | Expected | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Auth login (Cognito) | Works | Pending |
| Tenant switch `/select-tenant/` | Legacy table | Pending |
| Home / incidents / review / CAD / config | Legacy | Pending |
| Global FX defaults | All false | Code/seed certified; live env confirm pending |

## Per-wave validation checklist (execute after each enable)

| Check | Pass criteria |
| --- | --- |
| Authentication | Session intact after flag change |
| Tenant switching | `chooseTenant` still works |
| Navigation | Expected items; no dead links |
| Routing | Direct URL / refresh / bookmarks |
| Forms | Labels, save, validation, errors |
| Tables | Columns, actions, empty/loading |
| Dialogs | If present — confirm/cancel |
| Save operations | Same API success/failure as legacy |
| Feature gates | Product gates still authoritative |
| Non-pilot tenant | Remains legacy |

## Parity

For each enabled surface, compare FX vs legacy (second browser / flag off account) for workflow completion — not visual identity.
