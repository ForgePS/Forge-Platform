# 06 — Performance Results

**Phase:** FX-P1  
**Status:** **NOT MEASURED** — capture during live pilot waves  

## Method

For each wave (flags off baseline → flags on):

| Metric | Tool | Capture |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page load / LCP / INP | Lighthouse / Web Vitals | Desktop + tablet |
| Navigation transition | Manual stopwatch / RUM | Key routes |
| Table render | Performance panel | Lists with typical row counts |
| Form render / save | Network + timing | Create/save paths |
| API latency | Server metrics | p50/p95 for touched endpoints |
| JS errors | Browser console / RUM | Count by route |
| Memory | Performance monitor (spot) | Optional |

## Results table (fill during pilot)

| Route | Mode | LCP | INP | API p95 | JS errors | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/incidents/` | Legacy | | | | | |
| `/incidents/` | FX | | | | | |
| `/review/` | Legacy | | | | | |
| `/review/` | FX | | | | | |
| `/cad/messages/` | Legacy / FX | | | | | |
| `/configuration/` | Legacy / FX | | | | | |

## Acceptance

No unsupported claims. Mark wave acceptable when FX does not introduce user-blocking latency vs legacy for the same workflows.
