## Incident workspace sub-screens (sections)

Each section is a workspace tab/panel within SCR-008 (not separate routes). Specialty sections gate on permissions + `specialtyWorkflows` flag.

## Modals / overlays (in-workspace)

| Modal/panel | Host screen | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Officer review actions | SCR-008 / SCR-009 | Approve/return/submit |
| Specialty review | SCR-008 | Permission-gated |
| Attachment gallery actions | SCR-008 ATTACHMENTS | Upload/archive |
| AI narrative assistant | SCR-008 NARRATIVE | Multi AI flags |
| Searchable select pickers | SCR-008 / forms | Local component |
| Feature disabled panel | FeatureGate | Shared pattern |

## Dashboards

| Name | Present? | Location |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Executive dashboard | No | — |
| Operational dashboard | Partial | CAD operations |
| Personal / My Work | No | — |
| Module dashboards | No | — |
| Home hub cards | Yes | SCR-001 |

## Mobile views

No separate mobile routes. Responsive CSS + e2e `mobile.spec.ts`, `phase-3-mobile-matrix.spec.ts`. Shell has `mobileNavToggle`.

## Role-specific screens

No distinct role-only route trees. Visibility via flags + API permission enforcement. Role packs defined in `FORGE_RMS_TEMPLATE` / `RMS_*_PERMISSIONS`.

## Employee portal / public screens

| Screen class | In rms-web? |
| --- | --- |
| Employee portal | No (`apps/department-portal` stub) |
| Public registration | No (`apps/public-registration` stub) |
| Public CAD webhook | API only (not UI) |

## Incomplete functionality

| Screen | Incomplete aspect |
| --- | --- |
| Shell nav vs Config Studio | Dual sources; studio unused |
| CAD transports | Some not implemented backend-side |

## Planned screens (not inventoriable yet)

Personnel, training, scheduling, daily log, documents, fleet/apparatus, prevention tree, hydrants, preplans, reports, My Work, global search, notifications — track when UI lands; do not fabricate routes.
