# Workspace Migration Plan (FX-S2D)

**Document:** `09-workspace-migration.md`  
**Gate:** FX-S2D  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (default-off)

## First reference workspace

**Incident workspace** — the only high-risk record workspace present in `rms-web`.

| Decision | Outcome |
| --- | --- |
| Incident as first FX workspace | **Selected** — Personnel UI does not exist |

## Implementation

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Flag | `fx.rms.workspace.enabled` (default **false**, independent of shell/nav/dashboard) |
| Framework | `apps/rms-web/src/fx/workspace/` |
| Chrome | `FxWorkspaceLayout` + section panels with error isolation |
| Registry | `FxWorkspaceRegistry` — Incident registered as `rms-incident` |
| Deep links | Unchanged: `/incidents/{id}/?section=` |
| Rollback | Flag off → legacy `IncidentWorkspaceLayout` |

## Preserve

Record IDs, permissions, audit, attachments, deep links (`?section=`), edit/read-only states, NERIS validation, CAD panel data, autosave, review workflows.

## Out of scope

Forms redesign, tables redesign, new APIs, fabricated related records, Personnel/Prevention workspaces.
