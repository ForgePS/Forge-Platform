# 05 — Support Plan (GA)

**Status:** **DRAFT**  

## Model

| Tier | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| L1 | Tenant admin / help desk — confirm flag state, collect repro |
| L2 | Platform ops — feature overrides, rollback, monitoring |
| L3 | Product engineering — presentation defects only (no new features in hypercare unless P0/P1) |

## Playbooks

1. **User sees wrong UI** — check tenant effective flags; compare to expected wave.  
2. **Workflow blocked** — treat as P1; disable module override for tenant; restore legacy.  
3. **Suspected tenant leak** — P0; disable all FX overrides for tenant; escalate security.  
4. **Rollback request** — delete module override; verify legacy &lt; 5 minutes.
