# Navigation Migration Plan (FX-S2B)

**Document:** `06-navigation-migration.md`  
**Gate:** FX-S2B  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTED (default-off)  
**Decision:** DEC-S2-005 Controlled Hybrid — accepted

## Implementation

| Artifact | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Registry | `apps/rms-web/src/fx/navigation/navigation.registry.ts` |
| Adapter | `apps/rms-web/src/fx/navigation/navigation.adapter.ts` |
| Flags | `fx.rms.navigation.enabled` (requires shell) |

## Groups (live routes only)

- Home  
- Incidents (list, create, review)  
- CAD (operations, conflicts, messages, connections, unmapped, mappings)  
- NERIS (configuration)  
- Session (sign-in / switch tenant)

No Personnel, Fleet, Prevention, Training, or Scheduling groups.

## Behavior

- Product feature flags still gate capability items  
- Secondary nav shows sibling items in the active group when FX nav is on  
- Invalid combo `nav && !shell` forces legacy  

## Exit criteria

See `27-fx-s2b-completion-report.md`.
