# FX Offline Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 4)  
**Author:** Forge Experience Program  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-30

## Purpose

Standardize offline capability UX across every Forge product so field users get one honest sync experience.

## Scope

Presentation of offline/degraded states, queued changes, conflict UI, retry, and sync indicators. Sync engines remain platform/product.

## Goals

- One offline experience for all products  
- Users always know local-only vs committed  
- Conflicts are visible and resolvable through shared patterns  

## Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Cached record | Locally available for view/edit per policy |
| Queued change | Pending upload to server |
| Conflict | Server and local diverge |

## Responsibilities

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| FX | Banners, indicators, conflict dialogs, queue lists, retry chrome |
| Platform/Product | Cache policy, conflict rules, transport, encryption at rest |

## Required capabilities

| Capability | UX requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Cached records | Clear “available offline” affordance when applicable |
| Queued changes | Pending upload counter |
| Conflict detection | Surface conflict state; never silent overwrite in UI |
| Conflict resolution | Shared resolve pattern (keep local / keep server / merge when offered) |
| Automatic retry | Status visible; not silent forever |
| Manual retry | Explicit action on failed items |
| Sync status | Online / degraded / offline / syncing |
| Last synchronized timestamp | Visible in status bar / offline panel |
| Pending upload counter | Numeric, accessible |
| Failed upload queue | Dedicated list with retry |
| Offline banner | Persistent while offline |
| Connection restoration notification | Toast/banner when back online |

## Rule

**No product shall invent its own offline experience.**

## Best practices

- Distinguish draft, queued, synced, failed  
- Preserve layout when banners appear (Loading/Empty standards)  
- Deep-link failed items to records when permitted  

## Anti-patterns

- UI that looks identical online vs offline  
- Hidden failed uploads  
- Product-specific sync dialogs  
- Auto-resolve conflicts without user visibility when policy requires choice  

## Future enhancements

- Selective sync packs by module  
- Bandwidth-aware media upload  

## Dependencies

- Mobile Framework · Shell status bar · Record/Forms · Security UX  

## Implementation notes

FX-S0 documents contracts only. No sync service replacement.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Capability list complete  
- [x] Single-experience rule stated  
- [x] Conflict/retry/status presentation defined
