# FX Feedback States — Errors, Empty, Loading

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 4)  
**Author:** Forge Experience Program  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-30

## Purpose

Standardize error, empty, and loading experiences so every product feels consistent and recoverable.

## Scope

Full-page, panel, inline, and toast-level feedback using FX components and tokens.

## Goals

- Preserve layout stability  
- Avoid page jumping  
- Replace generic “Something went wrong.” with actionable copy  

---

## Error handling standards

Every error shall provide:

| Element | Required |
| --- | --- |
| Clear title | Yes |
| Human-readable explanation | Yes |
| Suggested resolution | Yes |
| Technical details (expandable) | Yes when available |
| Reference ID | Yes (correlation / request id) |
| Support link | Yes when channel exists |
| Retry action | When appropriate |

### Avoid

- “Something went wrong.”  
- Stack traces in primary UI  
- Blameful copy  

### Examples

- **Title:** Unable to save inspection  
- **Explanation:** The connection dropped before the server confirmed your changes.  
- **Resolution:** Check connectivity, then retry. Your draft is still on this device if offline drafts are enabled.  
- **Reference ID:** `a1b2c3…`  

---

## Empty state standards

Every empty screen should explain:

1. Why it is empty  
2. How to populate it  
3. Available actions  
4. Relevant permissions (when denial is the cause)  

### Examples

- “No inspections have been assigned.”  
- “No students match your filters.”  
- “You don't have permission to view this data.”  

### Variants

No data · No results · No access · First-run  

---

## Loading standards

Support:

| Pattern | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Skeleton Screens | Content regions; preserve layout |
| Progress Indicators | Determinate when known; labeled |
| Background Loading | Non-blocking refresh |
| Lazy Loading | Below-fold / secondary panels |
| Infinite Scroll | Where appropriate; always provide end state |

### Rules

- Loading states must preserve layout stability  
- Avoid page jumping  
- Prefer skeletons over full-page spinners for content areas  
- Mark `aria-busy` appropriately; don’t announce every shimmer  

---

## Responsibilities

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| FX | Patterns, components, copy guidelines |
| Product | Domain-specific resolution hints |
| Platform | Reference IDs, support URLs |

## Anti-patterns

- Blank white voids  
- Layout shift from late banners  
- Infinite scroll without “end of results”  

## Future enhancements

- Shared error code → copy catalog  

## Dependencies

- Design system · Security UX · Offline banners  

## Implementation notes

Documented for FX-S0; implement with shared UI package later.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Error anatomy defined  
- [x] Empty state rules + examples  
- [x] Loading patterns + layout stability rule
