# FX Product Boundaries

### Allowed product contributions

- Domain record types (Personnel, Student, Occupancy, Inspection, Incident, Hydrant, Apparatus, Equipment, LOTO Procedure, Permit, …)
- Domain dashboards composed from FX dashboard primitives
- Domain workspace layouts using FX workspace framework
- Domain terminology layered on FX components
- Product-specific empty states, help content, and guided tasks that still use FX patterns

### Forbidden product behaviors

- Forking a parallel component library
- Inventing alternate navigation metaphors for the same roles
- Building form engines that bypass the FX forms framework
- Creating one-off record shells that ignore the FX record framework
- Shipping inaccessible custom controls when an FX equivalent exists

## Boundary disputes

When a capability is shared by two or more products, default ownership is **FX**.  
When a capability encodes a single product’s regulations or business rules, ownership remains **product**, expressed through FX extension points.
