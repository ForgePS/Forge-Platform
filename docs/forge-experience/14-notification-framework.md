# FX Notification Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 3)

## Ownership

| Layer | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Categories, center UX, item anatomy, dismiss/snooze/archive presentation | **FX** |
| Delivery backends, preference storage, fan-out, entitlement | **Platform / product** |

Notifications must respect **user permissions** and **notification preferences**.  
Never use notifications to reveal restricted records.

---

## Notification categories

| Category | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Critical | Immediate operational attention |
| Warning | Elevated risk / soon-due |
| Information | Non-urgent awareness |
| Reminder | Time-based nudge |
| Approval | Approval requested / decided |
| Assignment | Work assigned |
| Completion | Successful completion |
| Failure | Failed job / action |
| Escalation | Escalated attention |

Severity presentation maps to status/priority tokens; category label remains explicit.

## Delivery channels

Notifications may be delivered through:

- In-app  
- Email  
- SMS  
- Push notifications  
- Dashboard widgets  
- Digital signage  
- Future integrations  

FX standardizes in-app anatomy and deep-link behavior. Other channels follow the same content contract where applicable.

## Notification payload (every notification)

| Field | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Title | Required |
| Description | Required short body |
| Priority | Required |
| Timestamp | Required |
| Related Record | When applicable |
| Deep Link | Permission-safe destination |
| Dismiss | Supported |
| Snooze | Supported when channel allows |
| Archive | Supported in notification center |
| Audit Entry | Created for send/act where policy requires |

## Center behavior

- Group by category or time  
- Unread counts in shell  
- Empty/loading/error states  
- Opening a restricted deep link fails closed without leaking existence beyond policy  

## Accessibility

- Polite/assertive live regions by severity policy  
- Keyboard operable list and actions  
- Do not steal focus for low-severity toasts  

## Anti-patterns

- Critical ops alerts as silent badges only  
- Marketing-style notification spam  
- Deep links to unauthorized records that confirm existence against policy
