# FX Dashboard Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 3)

Every Forge product inherits the **same** dashboard framework.

## Ownership rule

| Layer | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Presentation, layout, widget chrome, interactivity | **Forge Experience** |
| Queries, metrics, domain meaning, business rules | **Product** |

Dashboard widgets shall **never** contain product-specific logic.  
Products supply the data. Forge Experience supplies the presentation.

## Role-aware and configurable

Widgets may be enabled or disabled by:

- Creator
- Tenant Administrator
- Role permissions
- Subscription tier

Configuration changes presentation availability only. Authorization and entitlement evaluation remain platform/product services; the dashboard framework presents the resulting widget set.

## Widget behavior (all dashboards)

Every widget supports:

- **Movable** — user or admin layout placement within FX grid rules  
- **Collapsible** — progressive disclosure of dense content  
- **Optionally resizable** — within approved size presets (not free-form chaos)

Widgets use FX data components (Metric Card, Chart, Map, etc.) and design tokens only.

**Tone:** What is happening, what needs attention, what to do next.

### Personal Dashboard

**Tone:** Individual responsibilities and attention.

### Module Dashboard

**Purpose:** Module-specific metrics using the same FX widget chrome.

**Examples:** Fleet · Hydrants · Prevention · Training · LOTO · Academy · Personnel

Products register module dashboards; they do not invent alternate dashboard shells.

## Layout and density

- Built on `ResponsiveGrid` and dashboard breakpoint rules  
- Operations Display: larger tiles, fewer chrome distractions  
- Phone: stacked single column; collapsible widgets preferred  
- Empty / loading / error states required for every widget slot  

## Accessibility

- Widget titles as headings  
- Charts/maps provide text alternatives when critical  
- Keyboard reorder (when layout editing is enabled) must be operable without drag-only  
- Status and priority never color-only  

## Anti-patterns

- Embedding product business rules inside widget components  
- One-off dashboard chrome per product  
- Non-collapsible walls of charts  
- Widgets that navigate via schema names (“Collections”, “Tables”)
