# FX Workflow Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 3)

Workflow is standardized across every Forge product.

## Ownership

| Layer | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Shared state names, transition UX, audit/notification hooks (presentation) | **FX** |
| Business rule validation, entitlement, domain side effects | **Product / platform** |

Products may **extend** the state set.  
Products may **not** redefine the behavior of shared workflow states.

## Shared workflow states

| State | Meaning (shared behavior) |
| --- | --- |
| Draft | Editable pre-submit work |
| Pending | Submitted / awaiting pick-up |
| Assigned | Owned by an actor |
| In Progress | Active work |
| Waiting | Blocked on external dependency |
| Needs Review | Awaiting review decision |
| Approved | Affirmative decision complete |
| Published | Made available / issued |
| Completed | Successful terminal (non-archive) |
| Archived | Retained, not active |
| Cancelled | Stopped without completion |
| Rejected | Negative decision terminal |
| Expired | Time-bounded invalid |
| Deleted | Removed per policy (usually soft + audit) |

Status presentation uses FX Status Badge tokens and labels. Do not invent synonyms that break cross-product literacy (for example renaming “Needs Review” to unrelated jargon in the shared badge).

---

## Transition contract

Every workflow transition shall include:

| Element | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Who | Actor identity |
| When | Timestamp |
| Why | Reason / comment when policy requires |
| Source State | Prior state |
| Destination State | New state |
| Audit Entry | Written audit/timeline event |
| Notification Trigger | Evaluated (may no-op) |
| Permission Validation | Server authoritative |
| Business Rule Validation | Product/platform rules |

FX presents transition dialogs, busy states, failures, and resulting badges. FX does not bypass server validation.

## UX patterns

- Primary action advances the happy path  
- Rejection/cancel use Confirmation Dialog + reason when required  
- Illegal transitions are omitted, not shown as broken controls  
- Timeline shows immutable transition events  

## Anti-patterns

- Product A and Product B using the same label for different behaviors  
- Silent state changes without audit  
- Client-only “approved” flags  
- Deep custom state machines that ignore shared states for common verbs
