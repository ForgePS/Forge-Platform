# FX Migration Strategy

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (planning)  
**Author:** Forge Experience Program  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-30

## Purpose

Plan safe migration onto FX without big-bang production risk.

## Scope

UI/UX adoption only after FX approval + platform stabilization. No backend rewrites as part of FX migration.

## Goals

- RMS reference implementation first  
- Strangle legacy UI module-by-module  
- Preserve auth, tenancy, APIs  

## Strategy

1. **Inventory** product screens vs FX patterns (gap analysis).  
2. **Stand up** shared FX UI package consuming tokens (post-approval).  
3. **Adopt in RMS** high-traffic shells/workspaces as reference.  
4. **Migrate Academy** reusing RMS/FX components.  
5. **Migrate Industrial Safety** same.  
6. **Default** new apps to FX.  

## Non-goals

- Replacing auth, search, notification, or workflow engines in FX-S0  
- Parallel permanent design systems  

## Risks

See [34-risk-register.md](./34-risk-register.md).
