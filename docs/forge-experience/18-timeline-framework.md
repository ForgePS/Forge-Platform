# FX Timeline Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 3)

Every record contains a **standardized timeline**.

## Ownership

| Layer | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Event anatomy, immutability UX, filter/search/expand chrome | **FX** |
| Event production, retention, redaction policy | **Platform / product** |

## Immutability

Timeline entries are **immutable**.  
Corrections are new entries (or linked audit amendments), never silent edits of history.

---

## Standard timeline entry types

| Entry | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Created | Record created |
| Updated | Record updated |
| Viewed | View event when policy records views |
| Assigned | Assignment change |
| Approved | Approval decision |
| Rejected | Rejection decision |
| Comment Added | Comment/note |
| Document Uploaded | Document added |
| Photo Added | Photo added |
| Status Changed | Status change |
| Workflow Transition | Explicit workflow transition (includes from/to) |
| Notification Sent | Notification dispatched |
| Export Generated | Export produced |

Products may extend entry types. They may not remove immutability or shared anatomy.

## Entry anatomy

Every entry presents:

- Timestamp  
- Actor (when applicable)  
- Entry type label  
- Summary  
- Optional deep link / audit link  
- Optional structured from→to for transitions  

## Capabilities

| Capability | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Filtering | By type, actor, date range |
| Search | Within timeline summaries |
| Expand | Progressive detail |
| Collapse | Default compact list |
| Audit Links | To audit views when permitted |
| Deep Links | To related artifacts when permitted |

## Placement

Timeline appears in the shared workspace layout and as the Timeline tab when applicable ([11-workspace-framework.md](./11-workspace-framework.md)).

## Accessibility

- Ordered list semantics  
- Time as accessible text  
- Expand controls named  

## Anti-patterns

- Editable history rows  
- Chat-style mutable threads presented as audit timeline  
- Color-only event type encoding  
- Product-specific timeline chrome
