# FX Forms Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 3)

All forms inherit common behavior.  
Forms support **records**. Forms must never become the application.

## Ownership

| Layer | Owner |
| --- | --- |
| Control behavior, layout patterns, validation UX, wizard chrome | **FX** |
| Field schemas, business validation, prefills, approval routing rules | **Product / platform** |

Form templates must be **reusable across products** via FX forms patterns and controls ([components/forms.md](./components/forms.md)).

## Supported capabilities

| Capability | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Single Page Forms | Default for simple records |
| Multi-Step Wizards | Wizard + Stepper chrome |
| Tabbed Forms | Within workspace Details — not a nav tree |
| Dynamic Sections | Show/hide sections progressively |
| Conditional Logic | Product rules; FX presents resulting UI |
| Calculated Fields | Read-only computed presentation |
| Auto Save | Draft persistence with clear dirty/saved state |
| Draft Recovery | Restore after interrupt |
| Version History | When platform versions form data |
| Approval Routing | Hands off to workflow/approvals UX |
| Digital Signatures | Signature Capture control |
| Image Upload | FX upload control |
| Document Upload | FX upload control |
| Barcode Scanning | Barcode Scanner control + fallback entry |
| QR Scanning | QR Scanner control + fallback entry |
| Offline Completion | With Offline Framework state honesty |
| Validation Rules | Field + summary errors |
| Prefill Rules | Product-supplied values |
| Cross-field Validation | Surfaced in Validation Summary |
| Related Record Lookup | Lookup controls |

## Behavior standards

- Record title/status remain visible while editing (workspace header)  
- Labels above fields; placeholder is never the only label  
- Validation Summary at top on submit failure; focus moves to first error  
- Auto-save must never imply server commit when only local draft exists  
- Destructive clears require confirmation  

## Accessibility

- Associated labels; `aria-describedby` for errors/hints  
- Required indicated in text  
- Wizard steps announced  
- Scanner flows keyboard/manual fallback  

## Responsive

- Single column on phone  
- Wizard steps full-width  
- Touch-friendly targets (`space` + 44px)  

## Anti-patterns

- Product-specific form engines  
- Placeholder-as-label  
- Multi-step flows without Stepper  
- Hiding Validation Summary  
- Offline UI that looks identical to online committed state
