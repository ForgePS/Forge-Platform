# FX Operational Cards

**Family:** Operational  
**Pattern:** All operational cards share one FX anatomy; products supply domain fields.

## Shared anatomy

| Slot | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Identity | Title + record type label |
| Status | Status Badge |
| Priority | Priority Badge (optional) |
| Meta | Key facts (due, location, assignee) |
| Attention | Why it needs action now |
| Actions | Primary + overflow |

## Shared contract

- **Purpose:** Role-driven attention objects for queues, My Work, dashboards, maps popovers  
- **Properties:** `title`, `status`, `priority`, `meta[]`, `href`, `actions`, `domain`  
- **Variants:** Compact · Standard · Expanded  
- **States:** default, hover, focus, selected, loading, disabled  
- **Permissions:** Actions omitted when unauthorized  
- **Accessibility:** Article/group with labelled title; status not color-only  
- **Keyboard:** Card is link or has explicit action buttons (avoid whole-card + nested button traps)  
- **Screen reader:** Announce type + title + status  
- **Responsive:** Full width on phone; 2–4 column grids on desktop  
- **Examples:** Overdue inspection in My Work  
- **Anti-patterns:** Unique card chrome per product; embedding full forms in cards  
- **Future extension points:** Domain field packs registered per card type below
