# FX Action Components

**Family:** Actions  
**Tokens:** `color.action.*`, typography.label/body, space, radius, motion, elevation  
**Template:** [_TEMPLATE.md](./_TEMPLATE.md)

Shared rules for all action components:

- **Permissions:** Prefer omit unauthorized actions; if shown disabled, provide reason  
- **Accessibility:** Visible name or `aria-label`; focus ring via `color.border.focus`  
- **Keyboard:** Enter/Space activate; Esc closes menus/dialogs  
- **Screen reader:** Announce loading/busy; dialogs labelled by title  
- **Responsive:** Critical primary CTAs may go full-width on phone; FAB on field/phone  
- **Anti-patterns (family):** Multiple competing primaries; icon-only for irreversible actions  
- **Future extension points:** Product icons only from FX icon set; no one-off button skins
