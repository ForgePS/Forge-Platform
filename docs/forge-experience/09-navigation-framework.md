# FX Navigation Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 2)

## Depth rule

**Maximum navigation depth is three visible levels.**

| Level | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Level 1 | Major work area | Operations |
| Level 2 | Module | Inspections |
| Level 3 | Workspace tabs | Queue · Map · Reports |

Never exceed three visible navigation levels.  
Use **record tabs** instead of deeper navigation whenever possible.

## Organize around work — not database structure

### Do

- Operations  
- Personnel  
- Training  
- Fleet  
- Prevention  
- Communications  
- Administration  

### Do not

- Collections  
- Tables  
- Settings (as a dumping ground)  
- Miscellaneous  
- Data  
- System  

Administration is allowed as a Level-1 **work area** for entitled admins; it still uses work-oriented module names (Users, Roles, Integrations) — not schema names.

## Behavior standards

- Primary + secondary nav share identical interaction across products  
- Active route uses `aria-current="page"`  
- Unauthorized destinations are omitted (prefer omit over disabled tease when disclosure is sensitive)  
- Product Switcher changes product extension, not shell metaphor  
- Breadcrumbs mirror the three-level IA only  

## Responsive behavior

| Breakpoint | Nav presentation |
| --- | --- |
| Phone | Sheets / bottom nav; breadcrumbs collapse |
| Tablet portrait | Collapsible rail |
| Tablet landscape / desktop | Expanded sidebar |
| Operations display | Optional simplified primary list; favor content |

## Anti-patterns

- Four-level trees  
- Duplicate “Home” metaphors per module  
- Schema-driven menus  
- Different nav interaction models per product
