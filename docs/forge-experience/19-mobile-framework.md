# FX Mobile Framework

**Program:** Forge Experience (FX)  
**Version:** FX-S0  
**Status:** APPROVED (Part 4)  
**Author:** Forge Experience Program  
**Last Updated:** 2026-07-30

## Purpose

Make mobile and tablet first-class Forge experiences where operationally appropriate — not compressed desktops.

## Scope

Shared mobile/tablet behavior for shell, components, workspaces, My Work, forms, scanners, camera, GPS, and offline-aware UX across RMS, Academy, Industrial Safety, and future products.

## Goals

- Field users never have to zoom to use the application  
- Touch-first interactions with minimum **44×44** CSS px targets  
- Consistent behavior across phone, tablet, desktop, and large displays  
- Operational clarity: what is happening, what needs attention, what to do next  

## Definitions

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Mobile-first (operational) | Design for field constraints first when the workflow is field-primary |
| Touch target | Minimum interactive hit area 44×44 CSS px |
| Landscape-first (tablet) | Prefer landscape compositions for apparatus/inspection tablets |

## Responsibilities

| Owner | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| FX | Breakpoint behavior, touch patterns, component responsive contracts |
| Product | Domain content, camera/GPS payloads, offline sync rules via Offline Framework |
| Platform | Device permissions, push, hardware integrations |

## Required surface support

Every shared component must support:

- Desktop  
- Tablet Landscape  
- Tablet Portrait  
- Phone Landscape  
- Phone Portrait  
- Large Display  
- Digital Dashboard  

Breakpoint tokens: see [05-design-tokens.md](./05-design-tokens.md) / `tokens/breakpoints.json`.

## Touch interactions

| Capability | Standard |
| --- | --- |
| Minimum touch target | 44×44 CSS px |
| Swipe Actions | Allowed on list rows with visible alternatives |
| Long Press | Secondary actions / context; must have keyboard/mouse equivalent |
| Quick Actions | FAB / sheet patterns on phone; shell quick actions on larger |
| Offline Drafts | Honest draft vs committed state (Offline Framework) |
| Camera Integration | Capture + permission-denied empty state |
| Photo Annotation | Annotate then attach to record |
| GPS Capture | Explicit user action; accuracy shown when available |
| QR Scanning | Full-screen capture + manual fallback |
| Barcode Scanning | Same + hardware wedge as future extension |
| Voice Dictation | **Future** — reserved extension; do not invent per-product |

## Tablet standards (primary field device)

Optimize for:

- Fire apparatus  
- Inspection tablets  
- Industrial safety tablets  
- Training classrooms  
- Hydrant surveys  
- Preplans  
- Incident review  

Support:

- Split View  
- Landscape-first layouts  
- Floating action buttons  
- Side panels  
- Large data tables  
- Stylus support  
- Signature capture  
- Offline synchronization indicators  

## Best practices

- Prefer list → detail routes on phone over tiny dual panes  
- Keep primary actions thumb-reachable  
- Use token spacing; never shrink below touch minimums  

## Anti-patterns

- Pinch-zoom required for primary tasks  
- Hover-only affordances  
- Product-specific mobile shells  
- Scanner flows without manual fallback  

## Future enhancements

- Voice dictation  
- Rugged device density presets  
- Glove-mode density token set  

## Dependencies

- Design tokens · Application shell · Forms · Offline · Accessibility  

## Implementation notes

Documentation and isolated prototypes only in FX-S0. No production shell replacement.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] Mobile/tablet surfaces documented  
- [x] 44×44 touch minimum mandated  
- [x] Field capabilities listed with fallbacks  
- [x] Tablet-as-primary-field-device standards captured
