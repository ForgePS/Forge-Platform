| Exception ID | Directive Reference | Current Implementation | Reason | Risk | Approval Required | Recommendation | Disposition |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AX-API-01 | §3 monorepo multi-`*-api` apps | Single `apps/platform-api` + `apps/worker-service` (domain modules inside) | Shared tenancy, auth, ops simplicity | Medium — coupling / blast radius | Architecture Owner | Keep consolidation; author ADR; split only if scale requires | **APPROVED EXCEPTION** (DEC-003); ADR follow-up |
| AX-SEQ-01 | §42 phase order (Academy/QR before full RMS acceleration) | Import, NERIS/CAD, FX advanced; Academy/QR not started | Prior product authorizations | High vs strict §42 | Program Owner | Prefer §42 going forward; exception covers existing tracks only | **APPROVED EXCEPTION** (DEC-004) |
| AX-RDMP-01 | One phase numbering model | Legacy technical-roadmap 1–17 coexisted with §42 | Historical accrual | High — planning confusion | Program Owner | Rewrite roadmap to §42; archive 1–17 as history | **RESOLVED** (DEC-005 / DR-1) |
| AX-QR-01 | §17A / Phase 5A before Academy | QR not started; Import/RMS advanced | Not authorized | Medium | Program Owner | Formal deferral until QR-S0 authorized | **APPROVED DEFERral** (under AX-SEQ-01) |
| AX-EXP-01 | §18 Export with Phase 5 Import | Import S1–S8 advanced; no exports package | Sequencing | Medium | Program Owner | Schedule Export in Phase 5 closeout | **APPROVED DEFERral** (under AX-SEQ-01) |
| AX-ACA-01 | §19 / Phases 6–8 AWS Academy | Firebase live; `academy-web` scaffold only | Migration not ready | Critical for §48 | Program Owner | Dual-stack until Phases 6–8 | **APPROVED TEMPORARY** (DEC-008); expiry = Academy acceptance |
| AX-RMS-01 | §20 full RMS module set | NERIS/CAD/FX/incidents slice; fleet/prevention/scheduling/etc. absent | Incremental delivery | High vs full DoD | Product + Program | Define MVP vs full parity before claiming Phase 9–10 complete | **APPROVED PARTIAL SCOPE** — completeness claims restricted |
| AX-CFG-01 | §12–§16 full Configuration DoD | ACCEPTED_WITH_LIMITATIONS; form/workflow builders incomplete | Accepted limitations | Medium | Product | Close form/workflow builders under Phase 4 | **APPROVED CONDITIONAL** — limitations remain open gaps |
| AX-AWS-01 | §4.1 full commercial org accounts | Staged single development account | Directive allows staged | Low near-term | Architecture Owner | Expand when needed | **APPROVED EXCEPTION** (DEC-006) |
| AX-DOC-01 | §31 / §39 / §41 exact doc paths | Docs exist under alternate names/paths | Organic growth | Low–medium | Program | Documentation map sprint | **TEMPORARY** — remediate in docs hygiene |
| AX-FX-01 | MD phases do not name FX program | FX S0–S2F complete; flags default false; pilot blocked | Adjacent UX strangler | Low if gated | Program Owner | Keep under flags; nest under Phases 9–10 UX | **APPROVED ADJACENT TRACK** (DEC-009) |
| AX-NERIS-01 | §20.11 NERIS path; AI expansion | P1–P4 delivered; Phase 5 / AI expansion blocked | Explicit hard stop | Low | Program Owner | Hold until authorized | **APPROVED STOP** (DEC-007) |
| AX-IMPORT-01 | Phase 5 Import acceptance completeness | S1–S8 delivered at varying acceptance states; S8 `NOT_READY_FOR_REVIEW` | Ongoing track | Medium | Product | Close acceptance gaps before Phase 5 complete claim | **OPEN** — tracked; not a structural exception |
