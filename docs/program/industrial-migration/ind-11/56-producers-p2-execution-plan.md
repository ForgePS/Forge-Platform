# Producers P2 Execution Plan — AWS Primary Pilot

**Date:** 2026-08-05  
**Status:** AUTHORIZED — Phase 1 **EXIT GREEN**; Phase 2 **prep open** (`59-producers-p2-phase2-prep.md`) — Auth export UNSIGNED  
**Authority:** DEC-IND-011, MD-1.0, DD-IND-1.0 · Signed record: `evidence/p2/00-authorization/APPROVE-PRODUCERS-AWS-PRIMARY-PILOT.md`  
**Product:** Forge Industrial Safety  
**Tenant focus:** Producers Rice Mill (`business-1782553339499`)  
**Target model:** AWS day-to-day primary for Producers only; Firebase read-oriented fallback  
**Not in scope:** Full IND-13 cutover for all Industrial tenants; true dual-write  
**Phase 1 exit:** [`58-producers-p2-phase1-exit.md`](58-producers-p2-phase1-exit.md)  
**Phase 2 prep:** [`59-producers-p2-phase2-prep.md`](59-producers-p2-phase2-prep.md)

## Goal

Move Producers Rice Mill operators from Firebase Industrial to AWS Industrial for normal plant work, without waiting for fleet-wide IND-13.

## Phase 0 decisions (LOCKED — 2026-08-05 workshop)

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Target model | AWS primary for Producers only; Firebase fallback |
| AWS tenant | **New dedicated production tenant** (do not promote `import-acceptance-tenant-a`) |
| Environment path | **Staging-prod dress rehearsal → production window** |
| Staging landing | Same AWS account; staging-prod stack/tenant |
| Operator hostname | **LOCKED (revised):** `https://producers-rice-mill.forgepublicsafety.com/` (flattened; nested `*.industrial.*` abandoned — ACM `*.forgepublicsafety.com` covers one label only) |
| Cognito roster | **Full Producers Firebase Auth roster** before cutover |
| Storage → S3 | **All Producers Firebase Storage objects** before cutover |
| Day-1 modules | Personnel, Equipment, LOTO, Sites/Areas, Documents, Training, Forms, Inspections, Incidents, QR Links, High-risk (CS/HW), Tasks, Messaging, Emergency Response |

**Still open (before Phase 5 / plant announce):**

| Open item | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Signed `APPROVE PRODUCERS AWS-PRIMARY PILOT` | **DONE** 2026-08-05 (Jeremy) |
| Production / staging tenant UUIDs | **DONE** — see `tenant-ids.json` + auth record |
| Staging-prod stack naming / CF aliases | **DONE** — flat hostname dark to CF |
| Named cutover window | Business + plant ops calendar — still open |
| Support / rollback contacts | **DONE** (Jeremy primary; plant ops TBD Phase 5) |

Phase 1 checklist: [`57-producers-p2-phase1-prep.md`](57-producers-p2-phase1-prep.md) · Exit: [`58-producers-p2-phase1-exit.md`](58-producers-p2-phase1-exit.md).

## Current baseline (P1)

| Item | State |
| --- | --- |
| Dev data load (Tenant A) | DONE — see `54-producers-dev-load-complete.md` |
| Dev Industrial UI/API against Aurora | DONE — see `55-industrial-ui-module-deep-links.md` |
| Creator Cognito → Tenant A entitlements | DONE (dev only) |
| Firebase production SoT | Unchanged |
| Cognito Firebase Auth import | NOT STARTED (fail-closed) |
| Storage → S3 blobs | NOT STARTED (docs are PENDING_UPLOAD / path-only) |
| Production / staging-prod tenant | **DONE** Phase 1 — see `58-producers-p2-phase1-exit.md` |

P1 smoke evidence: `evidence/wave3/api-smoke-tenant-a.json`, `browser-smoke-extra-modules.json`.

## Binding decisions before Phase 1

1. **Written authorization:** `APPROVE PRODUCERS AWS-PRIMARY PILOT` (template below) — **PENDING**.  
2. Tenant designation → **LOCKED:** new dedicated production tenant.  
3. Environment → **LOCKED:** staging-prod then production.  
4. Operator set → **LOCKED:** full Producers Cognito roster.  
5. File policy → **LOCKED:** all Producers Storage before cutover (AV engine decision still required at Phase 3 entry).

---

## Sequence overview

```text
0 Auth signature (decisions locked; signature pending)
1 Staging-prod tenant + infra → prod tenant twin
2 Cognito full Producers operator import
3 Storage → S3 (all Producers objects) + metadata repair
4 Final Producers data load + parity (staging, then prod)
5 QR resolver + Producers subdomain cutover
6 Pilot ops + Firebase fallback
7 Stabilize → IND-12/13 path (later)
```

Each phase has **entry criteria**, **work**, **exit criteria**. Do not skip exit criteria.

---

## Phase 0 — Authorization and design lock

**Entry:** P1 success criteria accepted by program owner.

| Work | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sign P2 authorization record | Program owner | Fail-closed without signature — **PENDING** |
| Choose Producers production tenant ID/key | Platform + Industrial | **LOCKED shape:** new dedicated tenant; UUID at provision |
| Hostname strategy | Platform | **LOCKED (revised):** `producers-rice-mill.forgepublicsafety.com` |
| Lock module allowlist for pilot day-1 | Industrial product | **LOCKED** — see Phase 0 decisions table |
| Confirm out-of-scope domains stay Firebase | Product | corrective actions, scan_*, WC satellites, etc. |
| Support + rollback contacts | Ops | Names, escalation — **OPEN** |

**Exit:** Signed auth record; tenant UUID assigned at provision kickoff; day-1 module allowlist published (**done**); contacts filled.

---

## Phase 1 — Production-like tenant and platform readiness

**Entry:** Phase 0 exit green (signature + contacts).

| Work | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Provision staging-prod Producers tenant | Same AWS account; not acceptance-A |
| Provision production Producers tenant twin | Same schema/flags pattern; empty until final load |
| Seed Industrial personas/roles on both tenants | Mirror IND-3V industrial admin + operator roles |
| Tenant feature flags ON (tenant override only) | Global Industrial defaults stay OFF |
| FORGE_INDUSTRIAL product + module entitlements | Full locked day-1 allowlist |
| Cognito app client callbacks for subdomain URLs | Staging + prod aliases |
| CloudFront / DNS prep for subdomain | Cert + alias ready; dark until Phase 5 |
| Cross-tenant negative smoke on industrial_* | Security gate sample |

**Exit:** Both tenants exist; flags/entitlements green; `/auth/me` + industrial bootstrap succeed for a synthetic admin; subdomain DNS not live to users yet.

---

## Phase 2 — Cognito import for Producers operators

**Entry:** Phase 1 exit green; full operator roster export approved.

| Work | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Read-only Firebase Auth export for Producers org | No password hash migration |
| Map users → Cognito + Tenant membership + roles | Email as join key; **full roster** |
| Bulk create Cognito users (temp password / force change) | Per `33-user-migration-plan.md` |
| Login smoke per role template | Admin, supervisor, operator (min) + sample of full roster |
| Comms: new subdomain URL + first-login password reset | Before cutover window |

**Exit:** 100% roster count match (or documented exceptions); each role template can sign in and reach entitled modules on AWS staging-prod.

**Fail-closed:** Do not disable Firebase Auth for Producers until Phase 5/6.

---

## Phase 3 — Storage → S3 and document usability

**Entry:** Phase 0 file decision signed; AV approach chosen (production scanner or time-boxed waiver).

| Work | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Inventory Firebase Storage objects for Producers | Read-only census + checksums — **full Producers set** |
| Copy all Producers Storage objects → tenant-scoped S3 keys | Per `32-file-migration-plan.md` |
| Update Aurora document metadata from PENDING_UPLOAD → ready | Soft keys + integrity fields |
| Presigned download path smoke | Equipment docs + LOTO attachments + certificates |
| URL rewrite pass for known Firebase permanent URLs | Where referenced in records |

**Exit:** Producers file set openable in AWS; object count/checksum sample pass; no permanent Firebase download tokens required for pilot paths.

---

## Phase 4 — Final Producers data load and parity

**Entry:** Phases 1–3 exit green.

| Work | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| Staging-prod full load + UAT | Full locked module allowlist |
| Maintenance notice + write-freeze window (Firebase Producers) | Short freeze preferred for production cut |
| Final delta extract → production Aurora Producers tenant | Idempotent loaders; evidence pack |
| Row parity + RLS verify | Sites, equipment, LOTO, personnel, day-1 modules |
| QR token policy confirmation | Dev load rotated tokens — remint / remap labels before Phase 5 |
| Operator UAT on staging-prod then production dark | Full day-1 allowlist |

**Exit:** Signed parity report; UAT checklist signed by Producers lead; freeze timeboxing accepted for cutover.

---

## Phase 5 — Producers-only traffic cutover

**Entry:** Phase 4 exit green; rollback drill completed (dry-run).

| Order | Action |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Freeze Firebase writes for Producers (or maintain mode) |
| 2 | Final micro-delta if needed |
| 3 | Enable `producers-rice-mill.forgepublicsafety.com` |
| 4 | Make Cognito primary login for Producers operators |
| 5 | Enable QR public resolver on AWS for Producers tokens (blue/green + Firebase fallback) |
| 6 | T+1h critical-path smoke: login → personnel → equipment → LOTO → forms/inspections sample → QR sample |

**Exit:** Producers plant ops running on AWS for locked allowlist; Firebase is fallback/read-oriented for Producers only; P0 = 0 at T+4h.

**Explicitly NOT done here:** DNS cutover for all Industrial tenants; Firebase Industrial decommission.

---

## Phase 6 — Pilot operations (first 14 days)

| Work | Cadence |
| --- | --- |
| Error/latency/support watch | Daily |
| Delta catch-up procedure if fallback reads needed | As needed |
| Defect triage (P0/P1 only for pilot) | Daily standup |
| Decision: continue AWS-primary / roll back / extend pilot | Day 7 and Day 14 |

**Rollback triggers (any one):** auth outage > agreed SLA; data integrity P0; LOTO unusable; QR unresolved critical path; cross-tenant leak suspicion.

**Rollback action:** Re-enable Firebase as primary for Producers; park AWS tenant as read-only shadow; preserve Aurora for forensics.

---

## Phase 7 — After P2 (later, separate auth)

| Item | When |
| --- | --- |
| Offline / scan sync | IND-10 residual |
| Production malware scanner | Before broad *new* document intake if waived in Phase 3 |
| Unmapped domains (corrective actions, scan_*, WC satellites) | Product backlog |
| IND-12 readiness gate | Before fleet cutover |
| IND-13 full Industrial DNS/SoT cutover | Separate authorization |

---

## Day-1 module allowlist (LOCKED)

| Included at cutover | Deferred / Firebase |
| --- | --- |
| Personnel, Equipment, LOTO, Sites/Areas, Documents | Scan legacy |
| Training, Forms, Inspections, Incidents | Corrective actions |
| QR Links, Confined Space, Hot Work | WC satellites |
| Tasks, Messaging, Emergency Response | Analytics placeholders; unmapped certificates |

---

## Risks that will block go-live if ignored

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Operators still on acceptance tenant | New production-bound tenant in Phase 1 |
| Full roster temp-password churn | Comms + force-change UX rehearsal in staging |
| QR tokens rotated / Firebase URLs stale | Remint/remap before Phase 5 |
| Full Storage copy overrun | Early Phase 3 inventory + parallel copy |
| Dual mental models (Firebase + AWS writes) | Single SoT after Phase 5; no dual-write |
| Skipping security gate | Sample cross-tenant negatives in Phase 1 |

---
