## Exit criteria vs result

| Criterion (plan 56) | Result |
| --- | --- |

| Tenant feature-flag overrides ON | **PASS** |
| Cognito Industrial callbacks include Producers host | **PASS** |
| CloudFront alias + ACM coverage | **PASS** (flat hostname) |
| DNS CNAME live to CF (pre-announce) | **PASS** — operators not announced |

## Known gaps (acceptable for Phase 1 exit)

| Gap | Disposition |
| --- | --- |
| Platform module `IMPORT` absent from catalog | Carry into Phase 4 / catalog fix; not a Phase 1 blocker |
| Full Cognito operator roster not imported | **Phase 2** |
| Producers plant-ops contact + cutover calendar | Soft gate — fill before Phase 5 |
| No Industrial tenant switcher in shell navbar | Sticky `forge-active-tenant-id` works; UX backlog |
| Acceptance-A still holds loaded Producers **data** | Do not promote; Phase 4 loads onto Producers tenants |

---

## Phase 2 entry

Phase 2 (**Cognito import for Producers operators**) may start when:

1. This Phase 1 exit remains green  
2. Read-only Firebase Auth export for `business-1782553339499` is approved  
3. Temp-password / force-change comms path agreed  

**Fail-closed:** Do not disable Firebase Auth for Producers until Phase 5/6.

## Explicit non-entry (do not start yet)

- Phase 3 Storage → S3 (unless overlapping planning only)  
- Phase 5 DNS announce / SoT flip  
- IND-13 fleet cutover / dual-write
