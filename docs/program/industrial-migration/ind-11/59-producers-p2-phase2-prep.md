| I2 | Dark hostname login smoke | **DONE** API smoke on prod twin (`login-smoke-prod-twin.json`) |

## Role mapping draft (confirm before import)

| Firebase / plant role signal | AWS role code (draft) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Business / plant admin | `IND3V_INDUSTRIAL_ADMIN` | Full day-1 manage perms |
| Supervisor / lead | `IND3V_INDUSTRIAL_SUPERVISOR` (seed if missing) | Approve + manage subset |
| Operator / employee | `IND3V_INDUSTRIAL_OPERATOR` (seed if missing) | View + create where entitled |
| Unknown / none | Operator default + exception log | Do not grant admin by silence |

Exact Firestore / claims field names: confirm during F3 against live (authorized) inventory — do not guess permanent mappings.

## Script sketch (not executed in this prep)

```text
scripts/ind11b-p2-auth-export-plan.mjs          # synthetic / refused without AUTH export approve
scripts/ind11b-p2-run-auth-export.mjs           # ECS/RO live — requires APPROVE signature + env gate
scripts/ind11b-p2-map-roster.mjs                # roster-export → membership plan JSON
scripts/ind11b-p2-cognito-create-dry-run.mjs    # AdminCreateUser plan only
scripts/ind11b-p2-run-cognito-create-staging.mjs
scripts/ind11b-p2-cognito-login-smoke.mjs
```

Gates (fail-closed):

- `FORGE_P2_AUTH_EXPORT_AUTHORIZED=true` only after E2 signed  
- `FORGE_P2_COGNITO_CREATE_AUTHORIZED=true` only after E3 signed  
- Default mode = dry-run / refuse live  

---

## Explicit non-goals for Phase 2

- No password hash migration  
- No Firebase Auth disable / SoT flip (Phase 5/6)  
- No Storage → S3 (Phase 3)  
- No full Aurora data reload onto Producers tenants (Phase 4)  
- No IND-13 fleet Cognito import  

---

## Ready-to-execute criteria

Phase 2 **execution** (live Auth list) may start when:

1. Phase 1 exit remains green  
2. `APPROVE-PRODUCERS-AUTH-EXPORT.md` signed  
3. Operator confirms **“begin Phase 2 Auth export”** in session  

Cognito **creates** require a second signature (E3) after freeze counts accepted.

---

## Immediate prep actions (docs only — this pass)

1. Draft unsigned Auth export approval.  
2. Scaffold `evidence/p2/02-cognito/`.  
3. Point plan 56 at this checklist.
