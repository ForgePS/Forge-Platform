# Forge Platform Program Governance

**Program:** Forge Public Safety AWS Platform Rebuild  
**Phase:** DR-1 — Master Directive Adoption & Governance  
**Effective:** 2026-07-31  
**Status:** ACTIVE  

## Source of Truth statement

The authoritative specification for this program is:

**`Master Directive.pdf`** (repository root)  
*FORGE PUBLIC SAFETY AWS PLATFORM REBUILD — MASTER CURSOR DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVE*

No roadmap, status report, Cursor directive, sprint plan, or architecture note may contradict the Master Directive unless an **approved architecture exception** or **approved directive revision** is recorded under `docs/program/`.

Implementation phase numbering follows **Master Directive §42** exclusively.

## Document hierarchy (precedence)

Higher documents govern lower documents. No lower document may override a higher document.

| Rank | Class | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Master Directive** | `Master Directive.pdf` |
| 2 | **Approved Architecture Decisions** | `docs/architecture/adr/*`, `docs/program/architecture-exceptions.md` (approved rows) |
| 3 | **Accepted Phase Deliverables** | Acceptance reports, release acceptances |
| 4 | **Implementation Plans** | Sprint plans, phase plans |
| 5 | **Cursor Development Directives** | Authorized Cursor mission packets |
| 6 | **Roadmaps** | `docs/technical-roadmap.md` (must align to §42) |
| 7 | **Project Status Reports** | `docs/project-status.md`, `docs/program/program-dashboard.md` |
| 8 | **Historical Documents** | Superseded roadmaps, archived summaries |

## Directive ownership

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Program Owner | Master Directive content ownership; revision approval |
| Architecture Owner | ADRs and architecture exceptions |
| Engineering Lead | Phase mapping, evidence, implementation status |
| Product Owners (Academy / RMS / Platform) | Product scope vs §19 / §20 / shared engines |
| Security Owner | §31–§40 compliance artifacts |

## Change approval process

Directive and governance changes follow `docs/program/change-control.md`.

Summary:

1. **Proposal** — written change request  
2. **Impact analysis** — phases, gaps, exceptions, products  
3. **Architecture review** — if structure, tenancy, security, or data model affected  
4. **Approval** — Program Owner (directive) / Architecture Owner (exceptions)  
5. **Version increment** — update `directive-version.md`  
6. **Traceability update** — matrix, phase mapping, dashboard  

**No silent edits** to the Master Directive or to governing program docs.

## Versioning policy

| Artifact | Versioning |
| --- | --- |
| Master Directive | Semantic program version in `directive-version.md` (e.g. MD-1.0) |
| Architecture exceptions | Exception ID + disposition history |
| ADRs | ADR-NNN; immutable once accepted (supersede via new ADR) |
| Roadmaps / status | Dated revisions; obsolete numbering archived |

## Architecture approval workflow

1. Identify deviation from Master Directive (or proposed new pattern).  
2. Open / update row in `architecture-exceptions.md` (or draft ADR).  
3. Architecture Owner reviews risk, alternative, and exit criteria.  
4. Disposition: **APPROVED EXCEPTION** | **REJECTED** | **TEMPORARY** | **RESOLVED**.  
5. Link exception ID in roadmap, status, and traceability rows.  
6. Temporary exceptions require an expiry or next-review date.

Undocumented deviations are **not allowed**.

## Phase approval workflow

Phases use Master Directive **§42** IDs: **0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5A, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12**.

1. Phase work requires an authorized Cursor directive or explicit program authorization.  
2. Delivery evidence is recorded against the §42 phase in `directive-phase-mapping.md`.  
3. Acceptance is recorded only against the §42 phase (product sub-tracks may nest under it).  
4. Reordering or skipping §42 phases requires an **approved architecture exception**.  
5. Hard stops (no Firebase deletion, no unauthorized GA/flags/GovCloud/Academy expansion) remain in force until lifted by Program Owner.

- Firebase deletion forbidden until AWS replacements accepted
