# Directive Deviation Register

**Audit:** DR-0 (revised) — **HISTORICAL**  
**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Authoritative dispositions after DR-1:** [architecture-exceptions.md](./architecture-exceptions.md)  
**Rule:** Deviations require explicit approval; undocumented drift is a gap.

| ID | Deviation | Directive Expectation | Actual State | Justification | Approval Status | Risk | Remediation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| DEV-API-01 | Consolidated `platform-api` / `platform-worker` instead of separate academy-api, rms-api, imports-api, exports-api, notifications-api, documents-api, reporting-api, qr-api | §3 monorepo lists many `*-api` apps | Single Nest API + worker; domain modules inside | Operational simplicity; shared tenancy/auth | **UNAPPROVED** (needs ADR) | Medium — coupling / blast radius | ADR: approve consolidation or split when scale requires |
| DEV-PHASE-01 | Delivery followed `technical-roadmap.md` Phases 1–17 and product authorizations (NERIS, Import, FX) rather than strict Master Directive §42 order | §42 phased order; Academy after Import/QR; RMS after Academy | RMS NERIS/CAD and Import ahead of Academy and QR; QR skipped | Business priority / prior authorizations | **UNAPPROVED** as standing policy | High — directive drift | DR-1: rebase roadmap on §42; authorize exceptions |
| DEV-RDMP-01 | Dual roadmap numbering (MD §42 vs technical-roadmap 1–17) | One authoritative phase model | Two conflicting schemes in docs | Historical accrual | **UNAPPROVED** | High — planning confusion | Deprecate 1–17 or map permanently |
| DEV-QR-01 | Phase 5A QR not started while Phase 5 Import advanced and RMS advanced | §42: QR after Import, before Academy | QR absent; Academy absent; RMS partial | Not authorized | Implicit deferral | Medium — blocks Industrial/asset QR | Authorize 5A or formal deferral |
| DEV-EXP-01 | Export Center omitted while Import Center advanced | §17 + §18 together under Phase 5 | Import S1–S8; no exports package | Scope sequencing | **UNAPPROVED** | Medium — incomplete Phase 5 | Schedule Export with Phase 5 closeout |
| DEV-ACA-01 | Academy remains on Firebase; AWS Academy not built | §19, §38, Phases 6–8 | `academy-web` scaffold; Firebase production | Migration not ready | Known dual-stack | Critical for §48 outcome | Phases 6–8 + migration |
| DEV-RMS-01 | RMS built as NERIS/CAD/FX slice, not full §20 module set | §20 full RMS | Strong incidents/CAD/NERIS/config/FX; fleet/prevention/scheduling/etc. missing | Incremental value | Partial product authorization | High vs full DoD | Scope MVP vs full parity |
| DEV-CFG-01 | Configuration Studio accepted with limitations vs full §12–16 DoD | Full builders + terminology/nav | Versioning/dropdowns/custom fields strong; form/workflow builders incomplete | Accepted_WITH_LIMITATIONS track | Conditional | Medium | Close GAP-CFG-FORM / GAP-CFG-WF |
| DEV-AWS-01 | Single development account vs full §4.1 org account set | Full commercial org | Staged single-account | Directive allows staged | **Acceptable staged** if documented | Low near-term | Expand accounts when needed |
| DEV-DOC-01 | Many §31/§39/§41 docs exist under alternate paths/names | Exact required paths | Large docs tree; naming drift | Organic growth | Unapproved naming | Low–medium | Documentation map (GAP-DOCX-01) |
| DEV-FX-01 | Forge Experience presentation layer advanced under FX program, not named in Master Directive phases | MD emphasizes products/engines | FX S0–S2F complete; pilot blocked on tenant | Adjacent UX program | Program-authorized separately | Low if gated | Keep FX under flags; align with Phase 9–10 |
| DEV-NERIS-01 | NERIS Phase 5 product AI expansion blocked; P1–P4 delivered | §20.11 NERIS submission path | P1–P4; Phase 5 blocked by authorization | Explicit stop | **Approved stop** | Low | Hold until authorized |

## Standing policy

**Adopted in DR-1** — see `governance.md`, `decision-log.md` (DEC-001–DEC-010), and `architecture-exceptions.md`.

1. Master Directive §42 is the phase SoT.  
2. Product tracks (NERIS, Import, FX) require written exception when they reorder §42 (AX-SEQ-01).  
3. Architecture consolidation approved as AX-API-01; ADR follow-up still recommended.  
4. Firebase deletion remains forbidden until AWS replacements accepted (DEC-008).
