# Directive Reconciliation & Governance Package

**Program:** Forge Public Safety AWS Platform Rebuild  
**Phases:** DR-0 (audit) → **DR-1 (adoption)**  
**Date:** 2026-07-31  
**Authoritative directive:** [`../Master Directive.pdf`](../Master%20Directive.pdf) — **MD-1.0**  
**Scope of DR-1:** Documentation and governance only (no code, schema, flags, or deploys)

## Executive summary

DR-1 adopts the Master Directive as the **sole governing specification** and
**§42** as the exclusive implementation phase model. Legacy technical-roadmap
Phases 1–17 are superseded as SoT (retained as historical appendix).
Architecture exceptions are approved and registered.

**Overall completion vs Master Directive:** ~**30%**  
**Governance status:** ACTIVE  

### Final recommendation (DR-1)

```text
READY FOR DR-2
```

DR-1 does **not** authorize FX pilot enablement, Academy/QR/Export/GovCloud
starts, NERIS P5, or any production change.

| Conflicting governing phase numbering removed | ✓ |

## Success criteria

| Criterion | Met? |
| --- | --- |
| Master Directive sole governing specification | ✓ |
| Governance documentation exists | ✓ |
| Traceability matrix complete | ✓ |
