# Program Change Control

**Program:** Forge Public Safety AWS Platform Rebuild  
**Effective:** 2026-07-31 (DR-1)  
**Applies to:** Master Directive revisions, governing program docs, architecture exceptions that change standing policy  

## Principle

**No silent edits.** Governing specifications change only through proposal → impact → review → approval → version → traceability.

## When change control is required

| Change type | Required? |
| --- | --- |
| Edit Master Directive content or interpretation | Yes |
| Change §42 phase definitions or order | Yes |
| Approve / revoke architecture exceptions | Yes (Architecture Owner + Program Owner for standing policy) |
| Rewrite roadmap phase model | Yes |
| Update project-status facts only (no policy change) | No — date the revision |
| Sprint summaries / evidence append-only | No |
| Application code / infra / flags | Out of scope of this doc — separate engineering change control |

## Process

### 1. Proposal

Record in `decision-log.md` (draft) or a short proposal note:

- What changes  
- Why  
- Directive sections affected  

### 2. Impact analysis

Must address:

- Phases (§42)  
- Gaps (`directive-gap-register.md`)  
- Exceptions (`architecture-exceptions.md`)  
- Products (Academy / RMS / Platform / Industrial)  
- Dual-stack / Firebase constraints  
- Pilot / GA / feature-flag implications  

### 3. Architecture review

Required when any of the following are affected:

- Tenancy / RLS / AuthN / AuthZ  
- Data model / migrations  
- API surface boundaries  
- AWS account / partition / GovCloud  
- Consolidation or split of services  

### 4. Approval

| Artifact | Approver |
| --- | --- |
| Master Directive revision | Program Owner |
| Architecture exception disposition | Architecture Owner (+ Program Owner if standing policy) |
| Phase reorder / skip | Program Owner |
| Roadmap / status alignment to approved policy | Engineering Lead |

### 5. Version increment

- Update `directive-version.md` (MD-x.y) for directive changes  
- Record decision in `decision-log.md`  
- Update `program-dashboard.md`  

### 6. Traceability update

Mandatory updates after approval:

- `directive-traceability-matrix.md`  
- `directive-phase-mapping.md`  
- `directive-compliance-matrix.md` (if status shifts)  
- `docs/project-status.md`  
- `docs/technical-roadmap.md` (if phase content shifts)  

## Forbidden

- Quietly editing `Master Directive.pdf` without version bump  
- Reintroducing legacy 1–17 phase numbering as governing IDs  
- Implementing product work that contradicts unresolved REJECTED exceptions  
- Treating Cursor mission text as higher than the Master Directive  

## Emergency clarifications

If a Cursor directive conflicts with the Master Directive:

1. Stop implementation of the conflicting portion.  
2. Log the conflict in `decision-log.md`.  
3. Escalate to Program Owner.  
4. Master Directive wins unless an approved exception exists.
