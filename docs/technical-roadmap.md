# Forge Platform Technical Roadmap

**Source of Truth:** `Master Directive.pdf` (MD-1.0)  
**Phase model:** Master Directive **§42** only  
**Updated:** 2026-07-31 (DR-1 — governance adoption)  
**Governance:** `docs/program/governance.md`

This roadmap retains technical detail for each capability area while aligning
**every governing phase** to Directive §42. Legacy Phases 1–17 are **not**
governing; see [Historical appendix](#historical-appendix--legacy-phases-117).

Exceptions that reorder or narrow scope are recorded in
`docs/program/architecture-exceptions.md`.

| §42 Phase | Capability | Status | Est. overall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Discovery | COMPLETE (freshness review due) | ~95% |
| 1 | Monorepo & developer platform | COMPLETE | ~95% |
| 2 | AWS landing zone | PARTIALLY_COMPLETE (staged account — AX-AWS-01) | ~85% |
| 3 | Shared platform services | PARTIALLY_COMPLETE | ~70% |
| 4 | Configuration platform | PARTIALLY_COMPLETE (ACCEPTED_WITH_LIMITATIONS) | ~55% |
| 5 | Import **and** Export Center | PARTIALLY_COMPLETE (Import advanced; Export NOT_STARTED) | ~45% |
| 5A | Shared QR platform | NOT_STARTED | ~0% |
| 6 | Academy core | NOT_STARTED (scaffold only) | ~5% |
| 7 | Academy advanced | NOT_STARTED | ~0% |
| 8 | Academy migration (Firebase → AWS) | NOT_STARTED | ~0% |
| 9 | RMS core | PARTIALLY_COMPLETE (NERIS/CAD/FX slice — AX-RMS-01) | ~25% |
| 10 | RMS operations | PARTIALLY_COMPLETE | ~20% |
| 11 | Hardening | PARTIALLY_COMPLETE | ~40% |
| 12 | GovCloud readiness | NOT_STARTED | ~5% |

**Current governing position:** Foundations through Phase 3 largely delivered;
Phase 4 accepted with limitations; Phase 5 Import in acceptance closure;
Phases 5A–8 not started; Phases 9–10 partial under approved sequencing
exception **AX-SEQ-01**.

**Not authorized by this roadmap alone:** Academy build, QR-S0, Export start,
GovCloud, NERIS Phase 5 / AI expansion, global FX flag enable, Firebase deletion.

## Phase definitions (§42)

### Phase 0 — Discovery

Inventory legacy Academy/RMS, preservation matrices, risk registers, and
discovery markdown required by Directive §2.

**Evidence:** `docs/discovery/*`, `docs/sprints/SPRINT-1A-summary.md`.

### Phase 1 — Monorepo & developer platform

pnpm/turbo monorepo, TypeScript, NestJS, Next.js, Vitest/Playwright, shared
packages, developer tooling (Directive §3 tooling).

**Evidence:** `docs/sprints/SPRINT-1B-summary.md`.  
**Exception:** AX-API-01 — consolidated API apps.

### Phase 2 — AWS landing zone

CDK commercial development landing zone: networking, encryption, storage,
database, messaging, compute, observability, backup, deployment identity
(Directive §4).

**Evidence:** `docs/sprints/SPRINT-1C-summary.md`, `infra/`.  
**Exception:** AX-AWS-01 — staged single-account.

### Phase 3 — Shared platform services

Tenant isolation, identity, authorization, person registry, organizations,
tenant management, audit, events/outbox, entitlements/feature flags, and
shared engines foundations (Directive §7–§11, §28–§30). Document and
notification **product engines** remain thin (GAP-DOC-01, GAP-NTF-01).

**Evidence:** `SPRINT-1D-summary.md`, `SPRINT-1E-summary.md`; ADRs 012–019.  
**Modules:** `apps/platform-api`, `apps/worker-service`, shared `packages/*`.

### Phase 4 — Configuration platform

Versioned Configuration Studio: dropdowns, custom fields, forms, workflows,
terminology, navigation, roles (Directive §12–§16).

**Status:** Product delivered; acceptance
`docs/releases/CONFIGURATION_PLATFORM_ACCEPTANCE.md` —
**ACCEPTED_WITH_LIMITATIONS**. Form builder and workflow builder incomplete
vs full DoD (AX-CFG-01).

**Modules:** `packages/configuration`, Creator Console `/studio/*`,
Tenant Admin, RMS runtime consumers.

### Phase 5 — Import and Export Center

Universal Import Center (Directive §17) **and** shared Export Center
(Directive §18).

**Import:** S1–S8 implemented at varying acceptance states; S8 remains
`NOT_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (see import sprint/deployment docs).  
**Export:** NOT_STARTED (AX-EXP-01).

**Modules:** `packages/imports`, `packages/import-center`, API/worker import
paths. Export package not present.

### Phase 5A — Shared QR platform

Shared QR generation, public resolver, access policies (Directive §17A).

**Status:** NOT_STARTED (AX-QR-01). Do not start without authorization.

### Phase 6 — Academy core

Academy domain on AWS shared platform (Directive §19 core).

**Status:** NOT_STARTED beyond `apps/academy-web` scaffold (AX-ACA-01).

### Phase 7 — Academy advanced

Advanced Academy capabilities (Directive §19 advanced).

**Status:** NOT_STARTED.

### Phase 8 — Academy migration

Firebase → AWS cutover pipeline (Directive §38).

**Status:** NOT_STARTED. Firebase deletion forbidden until replacements
accepted (DEC-008).

### Phase 9 — RMS core

Core RMS modules on AWS (Directive §20 core): personnel, training foundations,
configuration integration, incident foundations, etc.

**Status:** PARTIAL — NERIS schema/incident shell, master data, FX
presentation strangler (AX-RMS-01, AX-FX-01, AX-SEQ-01).

**Modules:** `apps/rms-web`, `packages/neris`, FX packages, CAD contracts as
applicable.

### Phase 10 — RMS operations

Operations depth: CAD integrations, NERIS submission path, prevention, fleet,
scheduling, EMS as specified (Directive §20 operations / §20.11).

**Status:** PARTIAL — CAD/NERIS P1–P4; prevention/fleet/scheduling largely
absent. NERIS Phase 5 / AI expansion **blocked** (AX-NERIS-01).

### Phase 11 — Hardening

Security, performance, accessibility, DR drills, observability completeness
(Directive §30–§36, §40, §44).

**Status:** PARTIAL — strong hot-path tests; DR restore proof and production
a11y incomplete.

### Phase 12 — GovCloud readiness

GovCloud org, compatibility register, partition deploy (Directive §4.2, §39).

**Status:** NOT_STARTED (stubs / discovery only).

## Nested product tracks (not §42 phase IDs)

| Track | Nest under | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Import S1–S8 | Phase 5 | Acceptance closure required |
| NERIS P1–P4 | Phases 9–10 | P5 blocked |
| Forge Experience S0–S2F | Phases 9–10 UX | Flags default false; pilot tenant required |
| AI Narrative foundation | Blocked expansion | Flags false; no product expansion |
| Industrial / Marketplace | After QR / later | NOT_STARTED |

---

## Current recommended next (authorization still required)

1. Keep governance current (DR-1 complete as docs).  
2. Import Phase 5 acceptance closure (no unauthorized S9).  
3. FX pilot only after tenant designation (not unblocked by DR-1).  
4. Phase 4 limitation closure (forms/workflows) when authorized.  
5. Do **not** start Academy / QR / Export / GovCloud / NERIS P5 without
   explicit authorization.

Full mapping: `docs/program/directive-phase-mapping.md`.  
Dashboard: `docs/program/program-dashboard.md`.
