# Trust Services Category Decision

**Document ID:** SOC2-SCOPE-007  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** 2026-07-26  
**Status:** Draft — requires management + auditor confirmation

---

## Decision rule

Do **not** include a Trust Services Category merely because it sounds desirable. Inclusion requires:

1. Material customer expectations or contractual need.
2. Controllable processes Forge can operate and evidence.
3. Willingness to sustain the category for an examination period.

## Category dispositions

### Security (Common Criteria) — **INCLUDED**

| Factor | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Customer expectation | High — multi-tenant public-safety SaaS |
| Existing controls | Strong technical base (Cognito, RLS, KMS, CI scans, audit events) |
| Gaps | CloudTrail, formal policies/procedures, access review cadence, some detection services |
| Decision | **In scope for readiness** |

### Availability — **INCLUDED**

| Factor | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Customer expectation | High — operational continuity for agency workflows |
| Existing controls | Multi-AZ capable Aurora/ECS patterns, CloudWatch, CloudFront; backup flagged for verification |
| Gaps | Formal BCP/DR, RTO/RPO, restore tests, incident severity for outages |
| Decision | **In scope for readiness** |

### Confidentiality — **INCLUDED**

| Factor | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Customer expectation | High — tenant isolation and sensitive operational data |
| Existing controls | FORCE RLS, `forge_app`, encryption design, tenant membership, Phase 2 isolation tests |
| Gaps | Formal confidentiality policy, data classification ops, DLP evaluation |
| Decision | **In scope for readiness** |

### Processing Integrity — **DEFERRED (evaluate later)**

| Factor | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Why considered | Incident records and NERIS-related processing accuracy matter operationally |
| Why deferred | PI criteria emphasize completeness, accuracy, timeliness of **processing** with formal QA controls; Forge’s near-term readiness should stabilize Security/Availability/Confidentiality first. Application validation exists but is not yet framed as a sustained PI control set. |
| Path back in | After Security/Confidentiality evidence is stable; with product-defined accuracy SLAs and automated integrity tests tied to procedures |
| Auditor guidance | **Recommended** before marketing any PI commitment |
| Decision | **Deferred** — not in initial examination target |

### Privacy — **DEFERRED pending external guidance**

| Factor | Assessment |
| --- | --- |
| Why considered | Cognito identity and operational records can contain PII |
| Why deferred | AICPA Privacy criteria are distinct from Confidentiality; require privacy notice, data subject rights processes, and often legal counsel. Including Privacy without those programs creates false readiness. |
| Existing coverage | Confidentiality + Security address unauthorized disclosure; development data policy exists |
| Path back in | After privacy counsel, notices, DSAR process, and retention/deletion procedures |
| Auditor guidance | **Required** before including Privacy |
| Decision | **Deferred** — seek counsel/auditor guidance; do not claim Privacy category |
