## 1. Environment inventory

| Environment | AWS account | Purpose | In readiness scope? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Development / current operating** | `511343547817` | CDK-deployed Forge platform, RMS, Creator Console, NERIS 1–2 | **Yes** — primary system of record |
| **Local developer** | N/A | Engineer laptops, local Docker/DB as used | Process controls only (secure SDLC); not a hosted “system” |
| **CI** | GitHub Actions runners | Build, test, scan, deploy | **Yes** — change and secure-SDLC controls |
| **Future production account** | TBD | Hardened production isolation | Out of scope until provisioned and boundary updated |

---

## 2. Data classification by environment

| Environment | Expected data | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development / current | Synthetic and limited operational test data; treat as confidential | Follow `docs/security/development-data-policy.md`; no production PII dumps without approval |
| Local | Synthetic preferred | No secrets committed; use gitignored env files |
| CI | Synthetic fixtures, no live customer secrets in logs | Gitleaks and secret scanning enforced |

---

## 3. Environment promotion

Changes flow:

```text
Local → PR → CI checks → merge → deploy to AWS environment
```

Evidence for change management lives in GitHub PR history, CI logs, and deploy records. See `../change-management/`.

## 4. Open environment decisions

| ID | Decision | Impact on SOC 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ENV-01 | Separate AWS production account timing | Boundary and complementary user entity controls (CUECs) may change |
| ENV-02 | Staging vs prod parity | Availability and change testing evidence quality |
| ENV-03 | Shared “development” used as demo/customer preview | Risk of production-like data in non-prod — track in risk register |

---

## 5. Naming note

Until a dedicated production account exists, documentation may say “development account” while the environment hosts the live Forge Public Safety platform under test/acceptance. Readiness language must describe this accurately to auditors — **do not imply a separate hardened prod account exists if it does not**.
