# In-Scope Services and Components

**Document ID:** SOC2-SCOPE-002  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** 2026-07-26

Maps the Forge system boundary to concrete services. Preserve existing controls; do not rename infrastructure solely for SOC 2.

---

## 1. AWS account and region

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Account | `511343547817` (Forge development / current operating account) |
| Primary region | `us-east-1` |
| IaC | AWS CDK (`packages/infra`) |

Production isolation into a separate AWS account may become a future scope refinement; until then, this account is the operating system of record for readiness work.

---

## 2. Compute and application runtime

| Component | Technology | Control themes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API / workers | Amazon ECS on Fargate | Least privilege task roles, secret injection, logging |
| Container images | ECR (as used by deploy path) | Image provenance via CI |
| Task networking | Private subnets + security groups | Network isolation |

---

## 3. Data stores

| Component | Technology | Control themes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Primary database | Aurora PostgreSQL | Encryption, FORCE RLS, `forge_app` runtime role |
| Object storage | Amazon S3 | Encryption, bucket policies, static site hosting |
| Secrets | AWS Secrets Manager | Credential separation (admin vs app), rotation path |
| Keys | AWS KMS | Encryption at rest for in-scope data stores |

---

## 4. Identity and access

| Component | Technology | Control themes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| End-user auth | Amazon Cognito | MFA-capable user pools, JWT validation |
| Tenant membership | Application + DB | Membership resolution before data access |
| App permissions | Application authorization layer | Permission checks beyond tenancy |
| AWS console / CLI | IAM Identity Center / IAM | Privileged access to cloud environment |

---

## 5. Edge and networking

| Component | Technology | Control themes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CDN / HTTPS | Amazon CloudFront | TLS termination, security headers (verified in Phase 2) |
| Origins | S3 + API origins | Origin access controls |
| VPC | Private subnets, NAT as designed | Limit public attack surface |
| WAF | Config-flagged / optional | Evaluate enablement as control gap if not active |

---

## 6. Messaging and async

| Component | Technology | Control themes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Events | Amazon EventBridge | Controlled event routing |
| Queues | Amazon SQS | Durable async processing |

---

## 7. Observability and audit

| Component | Technology | Control themes | Operating status (initial) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metrics / logs / alarms | Amazon CloudWatch | Availability + security monitoring | In use |
| Application audit events | Forge audit logging | Who did what, when, tenant-scoped | In use |
| AWS API audit | AWS CloudTrail | Account-level change evidence | **Gap — construct not implemented (OD-21)** |
| Threat detection | GuardDuty / Security Hub / etc. | Config flags exist; largely unwired | **Gap — evaluate** |

---

## 8. CI/CD and repository controls

| Component | Technology | Control themes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source control | GitHub | Branch protection, PR review |
| CI workflows | GitHub Actions | Builds, tests, RLS checks, gitleaks, cdk-nag |
| Deploy path | Existing Forge deploy workflows | Change management evidence |

---

## 9. Application surfaces in scope

| Surface | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| RMS Web | `https://d3ud5uzwd9js2z.cloudfront.net` (current distro) |
| Secure API | CloudFront-fronted API distribution |
| Creator Console | Administrative / creator UI path |
| NERIS Phase 1–2 APIs/UI as deployed | Within shared platform controls |

---

## 10. People and process (in-scope control activities)

- Access provisioning / deprovisioning for Cognito and AWS
- Change management via PR + CI + deploy
- Incident response and escalation
- Risk assessment and exception handling
- Vendor / subservice review (AWS)
- Security awareness training (program to be stood up)
- Backup / restore verification (Backup construct flagged — verify operation)
