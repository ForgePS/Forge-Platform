# Out-of-Scope Services and Components

**Document ID:** SOC2-SCOPE-003  
**Version:** 0.1 (draft)  
**Date:** 2026-07-26

Items listed here are **not** part of the current Forge SOC 2 system description unless a formal scope change brings them in.

---

## 1. Product / delivery exclusions

| Item | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| NERIS Phase 3 and later | Explicitly not authorized this sprint; Phase 2 accepted |
| Unreleased experimental features | Not customer-facing; not in operating system |
| Marketing websites not served by Forge platform infra | Separate systems if any |

---

## 2. Customer-controlled environments

| Item | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Agency workstations, browsers, mobile devices | Customer responsibility |
| Agency identity providers not integrated as Forge Cognito federation (if any future IdP) | Until contractually in scope |
| On-premises CAD / RMS / records systems outside Forge hosting | Customer or third-party systems |
| Customer email systems used for notifications | Subservice or customer |

---

## 3. Corporate / non-product systems (until scoped)

| Item | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| Corporate email, HRIS, finance systems | Not part of product system boundary |
| Personal developer machines (beyond secure-SDLC expectations) | Covered via policy/procedure, not as “system components” |
| Third-party SaaS used only for internal collaboration (Slack, etc.) | Vendor diligence may still apply; not in product TSC description until listed |

---

## 4. AWS services not currently operated as Forge controls

The following may appear in CDK config flags or open decisions but are **not** claimed as operating in-scope controls until implemented, tested, and evidenced:

| Service / capability | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| AWS CloudTrail (account trail) | OD-21 — not implemented; treated as **material gap**, not an operating control |
| Amazon GuardDuty | Config flagged / unwired — not claimed |
| AWS Security Hub | Config flagged / unwired — not claimed |
| Amazon Macie | Config flagged / unwired — not claimed |
| Amazon Inspector | Config flagged / unwired — not claimed |
| AWS WAF (if disabled in environment) | Only in-scope when enabled and monitored |
| AWS Backup (if not verified operating) | Confirm before claiming availability control |

---

## 5. Examination / certification artifacts

| Item | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| SOC 2 Type 1 / Type 2 report | Does not exist yet |
| Independent CPA opinion | Future engagement |
| Customer-facing “SOC 2 compliant” marketing | Prohibited until examination complete |

---

## 6. Scope change process

To move an item from out-of-scope to in-scope:

1. Update `system-boundary.md` and this file.
2. Update control matrix and risk register.
3. Obtain management approval.
4. Ensure evidence and procedures exist before claiming the control operates.
