## Classification legend

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| APPROPRIATE | Appears needed for current operating model |
| REMOVE | Candidate for removal |
| REDUCE | Over-privileged; tighten |
| INVESTIGATE | Insufficient information |
| EXCEPTION_REQUIRED | Keep only with documented exception |

---

## 1. AWS IAM Identity Center

| Entry | Detail | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SSO instance | `ssoins-722377dc9477a3a5` (ACTIVE, primary `us-east-1`) | APPROPRIATE | Account is Organizations management account |
| Identity store | `d-90667981af` | APPROPRIATE | |

**Account assignments:** Full permission-set assignment enumeration requires Identity Center admin API pagination in a follow-up review. Phase 1 records the instance baseline only.

---

## 2. IAM users

| Entry | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IAM users in account | APPROPRIATE | `list-users` returned **empty** — privileged human access appears SSO-based |

---

## 3. IAM roles (admin / deploy related)

| Role | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AWSReservedSSO_ForgeDeployAdmin_*` | APPROPRIATE | Used by `forge-dev` / forge-admin SSO sessions for deploy |
| `AWSServiceRoleForSSO` | APPROPRIATE | AWS service-linked |
| Other ECS/CDK execution roles | INVESTIGATE | Full role inventory not exhaustively classified this pass — schedule quarterly review |

---

## 4. Access keys

| Entry | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Long-lived IAM user access keys | APPROPRIATE | No IAM users present → no user access keys inventoried |
| Temporary SSO session keys | APPROPRIATE | Expected; not stored |

---

## 5. Cognito privileged / platform users

User pool: `us-east-1_VYjUFLXG4` (forge-development).  
Inventory generated 2026-07-26. Classify after human review of membership vs need.

| Pattern / note | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Synthetic RMS admins (`admin@rms-synthetic*.test` pattern) | APPROPRIATE | Phase 2 acceptance tenants |
| Bootstrap / founder emails (if present) | INVESTIGATE | Confirm still required for Creator Console |
| Disabled users | REMOVE | Candidate after confirmation |
| Unknown enabled users | INVESTIGATE | |

Raw Cognito export retained only temporarily for review preparation; strip PII before sharing externally.

## 6. Forge platform administrators

| Entry | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creator Console admin capabilities | INVESTIGATE | Map application-level admin permissions in next quarterly review |
| Database `forge_admin` custodians | REDUCE | Limit to migration/break-glass; runtime uses `forge_app` (verified task def :14) |

---

## 7. GitHub repository administrators

| Entry | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub org/repo admins | INVESTIGATE | No CODEOWNERS file; enumerate via GitHub org settings in human review |
| Environment approvers | INVESTIGATE | Check GitHub Environment protection rules for deploy workflows |

---

## 8. Database roles

| Role | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `forge_app` | APPROPRIATE | Runtime; no BYPASSRLS; FORCE RLS |
| `forge_admin` / master | APPROPRIATE (restricted) | Migrations and approved admin only |
| Table-owner / migration roles | APPROPRIATE | Not used by ECS runtime |

Evidence: `docs/compliance/soc2/evidence/testing/database-runtime-role.json`

---

## 9. Support-access roles

| Entry | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dedicated support-access IAM role | INVESTIGATE | Not identified as a separate named role in Phase 1 scan — may be absent (document or create under Support Access Policy) |

---

## Required human actions

1. Review Cognito enabled users and mark REMOVE/REDUCE.  
2. Enumerate Identity Center account assignments and permission sets.  
3. Enumerate GitHub admins/approvers.  
4. Confirm whether a dedicated support-access role is required.  
5. Sign this review (reviewer + date) before executing removals.
