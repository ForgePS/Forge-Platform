## Material gaps (priority)

1. **R-003 / R-013** — Access review cadence + incident response operating maturity  
2. **R-005** — Backup/restore evidence for Availability  
3. **R-009** — Policy pack APPROVED; sustain operating procedures in practice  

Do not begin NERIS Phase 3 as a treatment for these risks.
