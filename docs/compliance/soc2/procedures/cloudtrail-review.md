## Trigger

Weekly security operations cadence + after incidents

## Frequency / timing

Weekly sample review; full export monthly via evidence scripts

## Required permissions

- Ability to administer the relevant system (Cognito / IAM Identity Center / GitHub / ECS / CloudTrail read) per least privilege
- Access to write evidence under `docs/compliance/soc2/evidence/` (no secret values)

## Responsible role

Security and Compliance Owner

## Required approvals

| Situation | Approver |
| --- | --- |
| Standard execution | Operational owner (Security and Compliance Owner) |
| Privileged / High risk | Jeremy Powell (Founder) or designated Security and Compliance Owner |
| Emergency path | Incident Response Lead with post-approval within 1 business day |

## Exact steps

1. Confirm the trigger condition and record ticket/issue ID.
2. Verify requester identity and authorization against access-control policy.
3. Perform the change using approved tools (AWS CLI with `forge-dev` profile for development, Cognito console/API, GitHub, CDK) — no undocumented console-only permanent config for infrastructure controls.
4. Capture evidence (screenshots/exports redacted; prefer JSON from `scripts/compliance/` where available).
5. Store evidence using naming `YYYY-MM-DD_<control-id>_<short-description>` under the appropriate `evidence/` subfolder.
6. Update related registers if risk/control status changes (risk-register, control-exceptions, access-reviews).
7. Notify stakeholders; close ticket with completion criteria checklist.

## Evidence generated

- Ticket/PR link
- Before/after access or config summary (redacted)
- Script output or CloudTrail event IDs when applicable
- Approver attestation for privileged actions

## Evidence storage

`docs/compliance/soc2/evidence/` (access/, change/, logging/, incidents/, backups/, training/ as applicable). Sensitive raw logs: store metadata + integrity hash + protected location pointer only.

## Escalation

If blocked > timing SLA, escalate to Engineering Lead, then Jeremy Powell for High/Critical impact.

## Failure handling

1. Do not leave partial privileged grants active.
2. Roll back temporary changes.
3. Open an incident if confidentiality or availability may be impacted.
4. File a control exception only if management accepts delayed remediation.

## Completion criteria

- Trigger addressed within timing SLA
- Evidence filed and indexed (or metadata recorded)
- Approvals captured
- No secrets committed
- Related control owner notified
