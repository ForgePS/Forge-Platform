# Sneat theme provenance

Forge Platform adopts the **Sneat Free Bootstrap 5 Admin Template** (ThemeSelection, MIT, v1.0.0) as the shared visual language for:

- `@forge/design-system` (`--forge-*` tokens, Public Sans, layout/component primitives)
- `@forge/ui` (buttons, cards, form controls using `.forge-*` classes)
- `@forge/fx-design-tokens` (RMS `--fx-*` brand/surface bridge)
- Application shells: Industrial Safety, RMS, Forge Academy (and platform admin apps that import the design system)

## What we take / what we do not

| Included | Not included |
|---|---|
| Color palette (primary `#696cff`, body `#f5f5f9`, semantics) | Bootstrap 5 CSS/JS |
| Typography (Public Sans) | jQuery / template HTML pages |
| Radius, elevation, menu/navbar dimensions | Icon packs wholesale |
| Conceptual sidebar + content shell patterns as CSS primitives | Vendor PHP/Blade/asset trees |

Apps consume CSS variables and React components only. The download under `Downloads/sneat-1.0.0` is a **reference**; Industrial also vendors Free CSS under `apps/industrial-web/public/sneat`.

## Industrial visual SoT (2026-08-11)

**Sneat is the visual source of truth** for AWS Forge Industrial Safety. Firebase green / Inter / Tailwind shell rematching is **rejected**. See [industrial-visual-source-of-truth.md](./industrial-visual-source-of-truth.md).

Default palette (do not replace with Firebase `#8bc53f`):

| Token | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Primary | `#696cff` |
| Primary hover | `#5f61e6` |
| Secondary | `#8592a3` |
| Success / Info / Warning / Danger | `#71dd37` / `#03c3ec` / `#ffab00` / `#ff3e1d` |
| Body bg / text | `#f5f5f9` / `#697a8d` |
| Font | Public Sans |

Tenant branding may override approved tokens (e.g. logo URL, optional primary) without abandoning Sneat component semantics.
