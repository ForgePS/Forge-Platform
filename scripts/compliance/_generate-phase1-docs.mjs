## Purpose

${purpose}

This policy supports the Forge SOC 2 **readiness** program. It does **not** authorize claims that Forge is SOC 2 certified, compliant, audited, or Type 1/Type 2 complete.

## Scope

Applies to the Forge Public Safety system boundary documented in \`docs/compliance/soc2/scope/\`, including Creator Console, RMS Web, NERIS Phase 1–2, Cognito, Aurora PostgreSQL (FORCE RLS / \`forge_app\`), ECS Fargate, CloudFront, S3, KMS, Secrets Manager, EventBridge, SQS, CloudWatch, CloudTrail (when enabled), and CI/CD. NERIS Phase 3 is out of scope until separately authorized.

## Definitions

- **Privileged access:** Ability to change security configuration, read cross-tenant data, or administer AWS/IAM/KMS/Secrets/Database admin roles.
- **Production change:** Any merge or deploy affecting the in-scope AWS environment or customer-facing Forge modules.
- **Evidence:** Artifacts under \`docs/compliance/soc2/evidence/\` (no secrets or raw customer PII).

## Requirements

1. Preserve working technical controls; do not weaken FORCE RLS, \`forge_app\` runtime separation, Cognito authentication, or encryption to satisfy documentation alone.
2. Changes to in-scope systems follow Change Management and Secure Development policies (PR review + CI gates including gitleaks, RLS tests, and cdk-nag where applicable).
3. Privileged AWS and application admin access is least privilege, reviewed at least quarterly, and logged.
4. Security-relevant AWS management activity is recorded in CloudTrail when the control is enabled; application audit events record sensitive tenant actions.
5. Secrets are stored in Secrets Manager (or equivalent approved store), never committed to Git.
6. Data is classified and handled per the Data Classification Policy; Confidential/Restricted data uses approved encryption in transit and at rest.
7. Incidents are declared and handled per Incident Response Policy; backup/restore expectations follow Backup and Recovery Policy.
8. Marketing and customer communications must not claim SOC 2 certification status beyond approved readiness language.
9. Exceptions require documented approval, residual risk, compensating control, and expiry per Exception Management Policy.
10. Control owners maintain evidence per the control matrix and testing plan.

## Roles and responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Jeremy Powell (Founder) | Policy approval; High/Critical risk acceptance; claims restriction enforcement |
| ${owner} | Operational ownership of this policy |
| Engineering Lead | Ensure engineering practices implement requirements |
| All personnel | Follow policy; report violations and incidents |

## Exceptions

Exceptions are requested via \`procedures/control-exception-approval.md\` and recorded in \`controls/control-exceptions.md\`. Expired exceptions must be closed or re-approved.

## Enforcement

Violations may result in access revocation, required remediation, and incident declaration. Willful circumvention of tenant isolation or logging controls is treated as a security incident.

## Related controls

${controls}

## Related procedures

See \`docs/compliance/soc2/procedures/\` for operating procedures mapped to access, change, logging, incident, backup, and exception workflows.

## Required evidence

## Trigger

${trigger}

## Frequency / timing

${frequency}

## Required permissions

- Ability to administer the relevant system (Cognito / IAM Identity Center / GitHub / ECS / CloudTrail read) per least privilege
- Access to write evidence under \`docs/compliance/soc2/evidence/\` (no secret values)

## Responsible role

${role}

## Required approvals

| Situation | Approver |
| --- | --- |
| Standard execution | Operational owner (${role}) |
| Privileged / High risk | Jeremy Powell (Founder) or designated Security and Compliance Owner |
| Emergency path | Incident Response Lead with post-approval within 1 business day |

## Exact steps

1. Confirm the trigger condition and record ticket/issue ID.
2. Verify requester identity and authorization against access-control policy.
3. Perform the change using approved tools (AWS CLI with \`forge-dev\` profile for development, Cognito console/API, GitHub, CDK) — no undocumented console-only permanent config for infrastructure controls.
4. Capture evidence (screenshots/exports redacted; prefer JSON from \`scripts/compliance/\` where available).
5. Store evidence using naming \`YYYY-MM-DD_<control-id>_<short-description>\` under the appropriate \`evidence/\` subfolder.
6. Update related registers if risk/control status changes (risk-register, control-exceptions, access-reviews).
7. Notify stakeholders; close ticket with completion criteria checklist.

## Evidence generated

- Ticket/PR link
- Before/after access or config summary (redacted)
- Script output or CloudTrail event IDs when applicable
- Approver attestation for privileged actions

## Evidence storage

\`docs/compliance/soc2/evidence/\` (access/, change/, logging/, incidents/, backups/, training/ as applicable). Sensitive raw logs: store metadata + integrity hash + protected location pointer only.

## Escalation

If blocked > timing SLA, escalate to Engineering Lead, then Jeremy Powell for High/Critical impact.

## Failure handling

1. Do not leave partial privileged grants active.
2. Roll back temporary changes.
3. Open an incident if confidentiality or availability may be impacted.
4. File a control exception only if management accepts delayed remediation.

## Completion criteria

- Trigger addressed within timing SLA
- Evidence filed and indexed (or metadata recorded)
- Approvals captured
- No secrets committed
- Related control owner notified
